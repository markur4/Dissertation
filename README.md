### Summary

This PhD thesis integrates biomedical research and data science, focusing on
an *in vitro* model for studying myeloma cell dissemination and a
Python-based tool, `plotastic`, for semi-automated analysis of
multidimensional datasets. Two major challenges are adressed: (1)
understanding the early steps of myeloma dissemination and (2) improving
data analysis efficiency to address the complexity- and reproducibility
bottlenecks currently present in biomedical research.

In the experimental component, primary human mesenchymal stromal cells
(hMSCs) are co-cultured with INA-6 myeloma cells to study cell
proliferation, attachment, and detachment via time-lapse microscopy. Key
findings reveal that detachment often follows cell division, predominantly
driven by daughter cells. Novel separation techniques were developed to
isolate myeloma subpopulations for further characterization by RNAseq, cell
viability, and apoptosis assays. Differential expression of adhesion and
retention factors upregulated by INA-6 cells correlates with patient
survival. Overall, this work provides insights into myeloma dissemination
mechanisms and identifies genes that potentially counteract dissemination
through adhesion, which could be relevant for the design of new
therapeutics.

To manage complex data, a Python-based software named `plotastic` was
developed that streamlines analysis and visualization of multidimensional
datasets. `plotastic` is built on the idea that statistical analyses
are performed based on how the data is visualized. This approach not only
simplifies data analysis, but semi-automates analysis in a standardized
statistical protocol. The thesis becomes a case study as it reflects on the
application of `plotastic` to the *in vitro* model,
demonstrating how the software facilitates rapid adjustments and refinements
in data analysis and presentation. Such efficiency is crucial for handling
semi-big data transparently, which \dashedsentence{despite being managable`
is complex enough to complicate analysis and reproducibility.

Together, this thesis illustrates the synergy between experimental
methodologies and advanced data analysis tools. The *in vitro* model
provides a robust platform for studying myeloma dissemination, while
`plotastic` addresses the need for efficient data analysis. Combined,
they offer a comprehensive approach to handling complex experiments,
advancing both cancer biology and research practices, in support of
exploratory and transparent analysis of challenging phenomena.
