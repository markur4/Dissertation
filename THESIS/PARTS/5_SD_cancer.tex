\unnsubsection{Isolating \& Quantifying Subpopulations within Cells in Direct
      Contact with MSCs}%
\label{sec:discussion_novel_methods}%
This project aimed to develop methodologies for isolating cells after direct
contact with \acp{hMSC}. The primary challenge was the scarcity of \textit{in
      vitro} methods that could effectively separate and isolate adhering cell
subpopulations for subsequent molecular analysis. Most available techniques
predominantly focus on the quantification of cell adhesion
\cite{khaliliReviewCellAdhesion2015, kashefQuantitativeMethodsAnalyzing2015},
and often employ indirect contact setups, complex micromanipulation, or are
unsuitable for using live \acp{hMSC} as the immobilizing surface. To address the
limitations of current adhesion assays, we developed and enhanced innovative
methodologies, specifically the \acf{WPSC} and V-Well adhesion assays.

\textbf{Variability of Washing Steps}: Given the complexity of the requirements,
this project first attempts relied on simple and traditional adhesion assays
that rely on manual washing steps \cite{humphriesCellAdhesionAssays2009}.
Washing involves aspirating the medium, dispensing washing buffer, and
potentially repeating these steps multiple times. This introduces variability
due to differences in pipetting techniques, which affect the accuracy of volume
transfer \cite{guanAssessingVariationsManual2023,
      pushparajRevisitingMicropipettingTechniques2020}. However, adhesion assays don't
rely on precise volume transfer, but accurate detachment of cells adhering at
the well bottom. This introduces a new set of considerations for the pipetting
technique, especially since cells are highly sensitive to shear forces applied
by fluid flow. From the author's experience with washing experiments and
subsequent microscopic evaluations (data not shown), several factors could
contribute to the variability of washing steps:
\begin{enumerate}
      \item The distance of the pipette tip from the well bottom, which
            decreases during aspiration.
      \item The position of the pipette tip relative to the well bottom (center or edge).
      \item The angle of the pipette tip.
      \item The speed of aspiration.
      \item Accidental or intended contact between the pipette tip and the cell layer.
      \item The residual volume left after aspiration.
      \item \textit{The same considerations apply when dispensing the washing buffer.}
\end{enumerate}


In addition to user-dependent factors, other variables such as the cells'
position on the well bottom can significantly impact the outcome. To the
author's experience, cells located at the edge of the well don't detach as
easily as those in the center, while cells touching the edge are almost
impossible to remove. This phenomenon is likely related to the \textit{boundary
      layer effect}, where fluids slow down near the edges of the well
\cite{weyburneNewThicknessShape2014}.

Together, since both user-dependent and independent factors can affect the
outcome of washing steps, adhesive assays that replace washing are highly
desirable. Still, since washing is straightforward and some variability is
alleviated by the disciplined execution of washing protocols, it remains a
common method for adhesion assays.



\textbf{Directly Interacting Cells Contain Unexplored Interaction Scenarios}: It
is evident that direct and indirect contact to \acp{MSC} have varying effects on
myeloma cells. That difference is crucial for understanding changes in the
\ac{BMME} during MM progression \cite{fairfieldMultipleMyelomaCells2020,
dziadowiczBoneMarrowStromaInduced2022}. These studies utilize well-inserts to
co-culture myeloma cells in close \dashed{indirect} contact with MSCs. However,
such comparison of indirect \textit{vs.} direct co-culturing methods might not
fully represent the complexity of intercellular interactions
scenarios\footinteractionscenario found in the \ac{BMME}. This is exemplified by
this project, as it relied on the complex growth behavior: \INA cells aggregated
homotypically in direct proximity to those adhering heterotypically to
\acp{hMSC}, and detached through cell division. Furthermore, such methods fail
to capture the subtle variations in paracrine signaling concentrations, where
even a few micrometers of distance could significantly alter cellular responses.

Such knowledge shifted this project's point of view as well: Initially, our
hypothesis focused on direct heterotypic interactions, not expecting a \nMAina
population, but rather subpopulations within \MAina cells that are separable by
varying adhesion strengths. Hence, our assay employed strict conditions favoring
one growth scenario \dashed{heterotypic interactions}, with co-cultures
providing unlimited hMSC-surface availability causing predominantly heterotypic
adhesion, while the short incubation time prevented the formation of aggregates.
Despite these measures, our assay still captured cells emerging from recent cell
divisions rather than from weak heterotypic adherence as initially hypothesized.
This demonstrates the robustness of our method in separating subpopulations that
arising from unexpected interaction scenarios\footref{foot:interactionscenario}.
This can be a major an advantage over methods that summarize direct interactions
as one population. Analysing the non-adhering subpopulation within directly
interacting cells could provide valuable insights not just in multiple myeloma,
but also metastasis of other cancer types.


\textbf{Minimizing Variability}:
There are innovative adhesion assays that both
support the isolation of nonadherent subpopulations from directly interacting
cells, and avoid variability introduced by washing steps.

One simple method involves flipping over a 96-well plate, with surface tension
preventing medium spills as non-adhering cells fall to the surface for
collection \cite{zepeda-morenoInnovativeMethodQuantification2011}. However, we
found that the medium in fact did spill occasionally (not shown). Other
approaches involve sealing the plate, such as with PCR plate seals, and using
centrifugation to separate cells \cite{reyesCentrifugationCellAdhesion2003,
      chenHighThroughputScreeningTest2021}. Despite our efforts, we could not
consistently avoid air bubbles, which, after flipping, would contact the cell
layer and create dry regions during centrifugation.

The V-Well adhesion assay does not flip, but collects non-adhering cells into
the nadir of V-shaped wells during centrifugation
\cite{weetallHomogeneousFluorometricAssay2001}. This work profited greatly from
this method, while \dashed{to our knowledge} being the first to use cell
monolayers as the immobilizing surface. We value this method for its precision,
as centrifugation applies a uniform and configurable force, while the readout
remains straightforward, relying on the total fluorescent brightness rather than
individual cell counting.




\textbf{Specializing in Quantifying Adhesion or Isolating Subpopulations}: Most
adhesion assays primarily focus on quantification rather than isolation. The
author attempted to combine both quantification and isolation, but found that
the two goals can be mutually exclusive. The author summarizes the key
differences between quantification and isolation approaches as such:

\begin{itemize}
      \item Cell Manipulation for Harvest \textit{vs.} Readout:
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Isolation methods are designed to manipulate cells for easy
                        harvest. For instance, the \ac{WPSC} method uses a catching
                        plate to collect non-adherent cells for subsequent analysis.
                  \item Quantification methods, on the other hand, manipulate cells
                        to simplify the readout process. For example, the V-Well
                        assay, which pellets cells into a single location, allowing
                        for a pooled fluorescence measurement without the need for
                        extensive cell handling.
            \end{itemize}

      \item Optimization for Subsequent Analysis \textit{vs.} Sample Throughput:
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Isolation methods are optimized for detailed subsequent
                        analyses, such as RNA or protein analysis. For example,
                        \ac{WPSC} minimizes the introduction of biases such as those
                        from fluorescent staining, making it suitable for downstream
                        molecular assays.
                  \item Quantification methods are optimized for high sample
                        throughput. The V-Well assay, as an end-point assay, is
                        designed to efficiently handle multiple treatments
                        simultaneously, providing quick and comparative results with
                        lower cell numbers.
            \end{itemize}
      \item Handling of Cell Numbers:
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Isolation methods, such as \ac{WPSC}, require multiple wells
                        (e.g., 96 wells) to gather a sufficient amount of cells per
                        subpopulation, which is crucial for robust downstream
                        analyses.
                  \item Quantification methods, exemplified by the V-Well assay, are
                        highly efficient even with low cell numbers.
            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



Thus, this adopted two distinct techniques for isolating and quantifying
directly interacting subpopulations, each optimizing for different outcomes, but
also supporting the separation of subpopulations within direct intercellular
interactions.

Still, it is theoretically possible to insert microscopy steps into the
\ac{WPSC} method to scan the well bottom for later cell counting. Also, this
work effectively isolated cell pellets from the V-well plate for subsequent
fixation and cell cycle profiling. The process was
tedious and required multiple technical replicates to achieve sufficient cell
numbers for analysis. It also required removing \ac{hMSC} from the V-well nadir
to prevent contamination during pellet aspiration.

Together, while both methods can combine quantification and isolation, they
are optimized towards either of them. Knowing these strengths and weaknesses
could help to advance these methods in future studies.





\textbf{Rationales of the Well Plate Sandwich Centrifugation}: Inspired by the
principles of both flipping and V-Well adhesion assays, we developed the Well
Plate Sandwich Centrifugation (\acf{WPSC}) method to address the challenges of
isolating cell populations. This method innovatively combines elements from both
techniques to provide a more reliable approach to cell isolation. One of the key
advantages of WPSC is its ability to reduce the variability commonly introduced
by manual pipetting. Instead of relying on aspiration, which introduce
variability in cell collection and requires touching the well bottom for
complete removal of medium, WPSC employs centrifugation to remove non-adhering
cells. Medium is then returned by pipetting to repeat the process and maximize
non-adhering cell collection, as the number of detachable cells plateau after
few rounds of centrifugation. Hence, this approach compromises
between minimizing washing variability and isolating larger quantities of cells.

The 96 well plate format has advantages, reducing spilling when flipping the
sandwich, as surface tension kept fluids in place. The 96 well plate format also
reduces per-well variability by performing the same washing procedure up to 96
times.

The slow centrifugation speeds used during \ac{WPSC} are also decided after
thorough consideration. For this, one has to discuss how exactly
non-adhering cells detach during centrifugation. While centrifugal force is an
obvious factor, the properties of cell adhesion are unclear under dry conditions
during centrifugation. The author assumed that the cells are being pulled along
by the medium as it is centrifuged into the catching plate. Hence, the centrifugation
speed was chosen as fast enough to transfer the medium, without completely
drying the co-culture plate and minimizing overall cell stress.

A significant challenge in \ac{WPSC} is the dissociation of \MAina from the hMSC
monolayer. WPSC employs two distinct techniques to achieve this dissociation.
The first technique involves repeated treatment with the gentle digestive enzyme
Accutase followed by \acp{MACS}. \ac{MACS}, despite being effective, is costly,
time-consuming, reduces overall cell yield, and potentially introduces biases
due to CD45 antibody selection and the requirement for cold-treatment. The
second technique utilizes strong pipetting to physically detach non-adhering
cells (termed \emph{`Wash'}). It is important to note that these techniques did
not affect the protocol on detaching \nMAina from the co-culture, hence
providing for a consistent ratio of isolated \MAina to \nMAina across all
experiments. Ultimately, we preferred \emph{Wash}, as \ac{MACS} had to be performed
on all samples to ensure comparability, reducing overall cell yield which became
limiting for downstream applications, especially for \nMAina cells. Both methods
achieved comparable purity of \MAina cells, with few hMSCs per $10e4$
\MAina cells (purity assessment not shown). \emph{Wash} probably pofited from
the highly durable nature of primary hMSC monolayers, whereas \emph{MACS}
required dissociation of the co-culture.

Together, \ac{WPSC} offers a versatile solution for isolating hMSC-interacting
myeloma cells. It successfully balances the need for precision with the ability
to handle larger cell quantities. \ac{WPSC} could be adapted to other cell types
that combines monolayer forming and suspension cells.



\textbf{Key Points:} Ultimately, this work established two methodologies
that could represent a significant advancement in the field of adhesion assays,
providing cost-effective, precise, reliable, and reproducible techniques for
both isolating and quantifying subpopulations within co-cultures of directly
interacting cell types. They offered valuable insights into the mechanisms of MM
detachment and are potentially applicable to other research questions that focus
on growth and interaction scenarios involving multiple cell types.

\unnsubsection{Integrating Evidence and Hypotheses for a Mechanistic
      Understanding of Dissemination}%
\label{sec:discussion_framework}%
The results outlined in Chapter 1 encompass various aspects of multiple myeloma
research, including colonization of the \ac{BMME}, myeloma-\ac{MSC}
interactions, and the association of adhesion factor%
% \footnote{\footadhesionfactor\label{foot:adhesionfactor}}%
\footadhesionfactor
expression with patient
survival and disease stages. Such a broad scope invites the formulation of
generalized conclusions, potentially compromising scientific rigor. The
following sections aim to clearly separate hypotheses from evidence to guide
further research on myeloma dissemination.

\textbf{Integrating Observations of \INA in the Multistep Dissemination Model:}
The results gained in this work fit well into the multistep model proposed by
\citet{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020}. For most steps, observations
were made that could inspire further hypotheses and research:


\begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Retention:}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textit{Observation:} \INA cells attach quickly and
                        strongly to \acp{hMSC}, forming stable aggregates.
                  \item \textit{Hypothesis:} Myeloma cells are retained in the
                        bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) through strong adhesion to
                        \acp{hMSC} and stable homotypic aggregation.
                  \item \textit{Experiment:} Inject \INA cells into mice and
                        examine bone lesions. Compare the growth patterns in mice
                        co-injected with an ICAM-1 or LFA-1$\alpha$ antibody, which
                        dissolve homotypic aggregates \textit{in vitro} and prevent
                        \INA growth \textit{in vivo}
                        \cite{kawanoHomotypicCellAggregations1991a,
                              klauszNovelFcengineeredHuman2017}. If disrupting aggregation
                        leads to diffuse bone colonization rather than focal lesions,
                        it supports the hypothesis that strong adhesion and
                        aggregation are crucial for retention in the \ac{BMME}.
            \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Release:}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textit{Observation:} \INA cells detach from \acp{hMSC}
                        through cell division, and external forces can detach single
                        cells from \INA aggregates.
                  \item \textit{Hypothesis:} Myeloma cells detach from the BMME
                        through cell division and external forces after reaching a
                        minimal aggregate size.
                  \item \textit{Experiment:} Inject Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
                        stained \INA cells into mice and compare the cell cycle
                        profiles and BrdU signals of circulating cells versus
                        those in the bone marrow. Enrichment of G1/G0 cells
                        among circulating cells would support the hypothesis
                        that detachment is more likely shortly after cell
                        division.
            \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Intra-/Extravasation:}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item This study did not make experiments to study for
                        intra-/extravasation, but these phenomena could be
                        explored with similar methods, if MSCs were replaced by
                        endothelial cells.
            \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Colonization:}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textit{Observation:} \INA cells exhibit quick
                        attachment to \acp{hMSC} within one hour and rapidly
                        upregulate numerous adhesion factors, including \ac{ECM}
                        factors.
                  \item \textit{Hypothesis:} Quick attachment and fast
                        expression of adhesion factors enhance the potential to
                        colonize new niches. This is particularly relevant as \INA
                        cells were isolated from the pleura, indicating an ability to
                        colonize extramedullary sites
                        \cite{burgerGp130RasMediated2001c}.
                  \item \textit{Experiment:} Inject \INA cells into mice and
                        observe if they colonize extramedullary sites. Compare
                        this to \INA cells with reduced adaptability to test the
                        hypothesis. Research is required to find techniques to
                        reduce such putative adaptability: One potential option
                        is using XRK3F2 to inhibit p62, an upstream activator of
                        NF-$\kappa$B \cite{adamikXRK3F2InhibitionP62ZZ2018}. In
                        fact, NF-$\kappa$B signaling seems a robust target,
                        given that it plays a role both in MM patients
                        \cite{sarinEvaluatingEfficacyMultiple2020}, and inducing
                        adhesion factor expression in \INA (this work). Other
                        targetable genes are those proposed by
                        \citet{shenProgressionSignatureUnderlies2021} to be
                        master regulators of myeloma progression.
            \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


These hypotheses \dashed{based on observations from \INA cells} provide a
starting point for understanding myeloma dissemination. While these insights are
specialized for the \INA cell line, they inspire the development of a more
generalized framework applicable to a broader range of myeloma cases.



\textbf{Constructing a Generalizable Hypothetical Framework of Dissemination:}
A mechanistic understanding of myeloma dissemination remains elusive. Although
\citet{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020} described dissemination as a
multistep process, evidence is largely collected for individual steps, leaving
the connections between these steps unproven. As a result, the process of
dissemination is a patchwork of evidence fragments. The following sections aim
to integrate such fragments, especially those derived from the \INA cell line in
this work, to construct a more coherent understanding of myeloma dissemination.
To do so, this work speficies new terminology, including
% \emph{\ac{CAD}}\footnote{\footcad\label{foot:cad}}
\emph{\acf{CAD}}\footnote{\footcad\label{foot:cad}}
and \emph{\ac{CAD} dramatype}\footnote{\footcaddt\label{foot:caddt}}
or short \emph{adhesion dramatype}\footnote{\footadhesiondt\label{foot:adhesiondt}}.



\textbf{Distinguishing Phenotype and Dramatype:}
\INA cells exhibited great reactivity to \acp{hMSC}. Describing this new state
as a \emph{phenotype} would correctly imply the influence of both genetic and
environmental factors. However, this overloads the term \emph{environmental
      factors}, as it includes the history of the donor, decade-long culturing
conditions, the \textit{in vitro} model simulating the \ac{BMME}, and
experimental conditions such as the ratio of \acp{MSC} to \INA cells. Animal
studies faced a similar issue and hence coined the term
\emph{dramatype}
% \footnotequote{\footdramatype}{zutphenPrinciplesLaboratoryAnimal2001}
\cite{zutphenPrinciplesLaboratoryAnimal2001}: The dramatype describes the state
of the cells that is due to proximate environmental factors, whereas the
phenotype summarizes the overall environmental background prior to entering that
proximate environment. Cancer research uses the term dramatype rarely
\cite{hinoStudiesFamilialTumors2004}, or use combinations like \emph{phenotype
      switching} \cite{woutersRobustGeneExpression2020}. However, given the
micronevironmental and adhesional changes faced, the term \emph{dramatype} could
define distinct and potentially temporary adhesive behaviors of
myeloma cells observed for each step of dissemination. This distinguishes the
adhesion behavior and expression patterns from previous phenotypic
characterizations of bulk myeloma samples without undermining their validity.



\textbf{Introducing Adhesion Dramatypes:}
\acf{CAD}\footref{foot:cad} characterizes the time-dependent changes in cell
adhesion and detachment, associating these phases with molecular signatures like
\ac{CAM} expression or cell signaling mediated by the microenvironment. Focusing
on a time component is especially useful for predicting the behavior of
suspension cells with intricate attachment and detachment behaviors like \INA.
In that sense, \MAina and \nMAina are two distinct \textit{in vitro} adhesion
dramatypes. The adhesion dramatype of \MAina cells is characterized by adhesion
factor expression and stable heterotypic adhesion to \acp{hMSC}. This addresses
the retention and colonization steps during the multistep-model of
dissemination. \MAina cells then transition into another adhesion dramatype
\dashed{\nMAina} through cell division and loss of MSC adhesion, and is
characterized by unstable homotypic aggregation from which single cells detach.
This could represent the release step of dissemination.


\textbf{Key Hypotheses:}
The author introduces the \emph{Dynamic Adhesion Hypothetical Framework for
      Myeloma Dissemination}, which leverages direct observations of
\ac{CAD}\footref{foot:cad}, and is structured around four key hypotheses. Each
address fundamental aspects of myeloma cell dissemination based on both
literature and the results of this work:



\newcommand{\caddramatype}{ %
      \textbf{Myeloma cells change their adhesion dramatype during dissemination.}
      In response to different environmental cues faced during dissemination,
      myeloma cells switch, change or adapt their \ac{CAD}. These states are
      characterized by adhesion dramatpyes\footref{foot:adhesiondt}. Different
      steps in dissemination involve distinct adhesion dramatypes, or instance,
      one for specialized colonizing new sites and one specialized for vascular
      interactions. %

This framework sets the stage for a detailed exploration of each hypothesis,
linking empirical data with hypothetical constructs to provide a comprehensive
framework that can help to identify commonalities in myeloma dissemination, but
also inform the development of targeted therapies.

\unnsubsection{\caddramatypetitle}%
\label{sec:discussion_caddadaptation}%
As presented in Chapter\,1, \MAina cells exhibited upregulation of both adhesion
factors and chemoattractants, switching their \ac{CAD} adhesion dramatype
% \footnote{\footadhesiondt\label{foot:adhesiondt}} 
from homotypic aggregation to \acp{MSC} adhesion. Given that \INA cells were
isolated from an extramedullary site \dashed{the pleura}
\cite{burgerGp130RasMediated2001}, such changes likely facilitate colonization
of new microenvironments. This section explores the hypothesis that MM cells
adapt or change their adhesion dramatype not only during colonization, but at
each step of dissemination.


\textbf{Adhesion Dramatypes Assume Distinguishable Niches:} The multistep
model proposed by \citet{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020} posits that
myeloma cells acquire regulatory mechanisms specialized for each step of
dissemination. The author hypothesizes that the different niches involved in
these steps are unique enough to induce distinct adhesion dramatypes. This
requires thorough knowledge of separate niches.
\citet{granataBoneMarrowNiches2022} categorizes the \ac{BM} into sinusoidal,
arteriolar, and endosteal niches, each spatially and molecularly
distinguishable. The endosteal niche is home to \ac{MSC} and a majority of
plasma cells\footnotequote{We suggest that it is reasonable to approach the
      notion of physical plasma cell survival niches with some skepticism. It is clear
      that most BM plasma cells rely heavily on access to APRIL or BLyS (66, 70), and
      it appears that mature plasma cells are relatively stationary (59). However to
      us, that plasma cells must remain indefinitely in physical survival niches to
      survive is less obvious.}{wilmoreHereThereAnywhere2017}, and the vascular niches
\dashed{sinusoidal and arteriolar} include endothelial cells
\cite{zehentmeierStaticDynamicComponents2014, wilmoreHereThereAnywhere2017}.
Other niches encountered during dissemination include peripheral blood, lymph
nodes, and extramedullary sites. Comprehensive mapping and characterization of
these niches, including their adhesion molecules and soluble factors, is
necessary to understand the adhesion requirements for each niche. This is a
highly complex task, yet summarizing available information per niche could
provide a powerful basis.


\textbf{Distinct Adhesion Dramatypes Transitioning between Niches:}
Adhesion processes are well-documented in MM progression, particularly within
the \ac{BMME} \cite{bouzerdanAdhesionMoleculesMultiple2022}. However, the
dynamism of these processes remains unclear. Overall,
\citet{fredeDynamicTranscriptionalReprogramming2021} have shown that individual
myeloma cells can switch between alternate transcriptional states through
differential epigenetic regulation. Such states were associated with distinct
transcriptioal signatures like those of enothelial progenitors or enhancers
linked to CXCR4. This is indicative of myeloma cells having different \ac{CAD}
dramatypes. In other cancers, different adhesive phenotypes and transitions,
such as those seen in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are common
\cite{gengDynamicSwitchTwo2014}. For myeloma, EMT-like phenotypes have been
described, but a clear association with distinct adhesion behaviors is hindered
by the cells maintaining their suspension state
\cite{roccaroCXCR4RegulatesExtraMedullary2015,
      qianSETDB1InducesLenalidomide2023}. This work might be the first to identify
% adhesive subtypes
adhesion dramatypes through functional separation of detachable myeloma cells.
As presented earlier, exploring these findings further could reveal transitions
between adhesion dramatypes during MM dissemination, such as attaching for
colonization, or initiating release.


\textbf{Extramedullary Niche:}
Changing adhesion dramatypes predicts a specialized set of adhesion factors for
extramedullary niches. A distinct phenotype has been proposed for extramedullary
myeloma\footnotequote{Our analysis concluded that the gain of CD44, loss of
      CD56, loss of very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), imbalance of the chemokine
      receptor-4-chemokine ligand-12 (CXCR4-CXCL12) axis, [...] show an increased
      propensity [...] to leave the bone marrow and hone in extramedullary sites
      giving rise to more aggressive extramedullary diseases.
}{guptaExtramedullaryMultipleMyeloma2022}, characterized by changes in
expression of CD44, CD56, VLA-4, and CXCR4
\cite{guptaExtramedullaryMultipleMyeloma2022}. In support of this,
\cite{hathiAblationVLA4Multiple2022} demonstrated that VLA-4 seems to direct
myeloma cells to the BM, since ablating VLA-4 reduced medullary disease, but
increased extramedullary involvement. Furthermore, the role of CXCR4 in
mediating adhesion factor expression is well established, particularly in
extramedullary MM cells \cite{roccaroCXCR4RegulatesExtraMedullary2015,
      guptaExtramedullaryMultipleMyeloma2022}: Extramedullary myeloma cells
overexpress CXCR4, making them more responsive to cues that induce adhesion
factor expression, such as CD44/H-CAM.



\textbf{Vascular Niche:}
Changing adhesion dramatypes predicts a specialized set of adhesion factors for
endothelial interaction, supporting intravasation and extravasation. Although
not assessed in this thesis, the vascular niche is a popular therapeutic target
for preventing dissemination \cite{neriTargetingAdhesionMolecules2012}. Key
adhesion factors like JAM-A and N-Cadherin have been highlighted as potential
targets \cite{solimandoHaltingViciousCycle2020,
      mrozikTherapeuticTargetingNcadherin2015}. These factors were not differentially
expressed between subpopulations isolated in Chapter\,1, suggesting distinct
regulatory mechanisms for vascular versus \ac{MSC} interactions.


\textbf{Circulating MM:}
Changing adhesion dramatypes would predict that circulating MM cells lose adhesion
factors. Studies confirm that \dashed{compared to BM-resident cells} circulating
\ac{MM} cells exhibit reduced expression of multiple adhesion factors
\footnotequote{Our results show that CTCs typically represent a unique
      subpopulation of all BM clonal PCs, characterized by downregulation ($P$ < .05) of
      integrins (CD11a,\,CD11c,\,CD29,\,CD49d,\,CD49e), adhesion (CD33,\,CD56, CD117,\,CD138), and
      activation molecules
      (CD28/CD38/CD81).}{paivaDetailedCharacterizationMultiple2013}, including
$\alpha4\beta1$ and CD138/Syndecan-1
\cite{paivaDetailedCharacterizationMultiple2013,
      paivaCompetitionClonalPlasma2011, akhmetzyanovaDynamicCD138Surface2020}.
Evidence suggests that a dynamic loss of CD138/Syndecan-1 and gain of JAM-C
causes intravasation, circulation, and dissemination of MM cells
\cite{akhmetzyanovaDynamicCD138Surface2020,
      brandlJunctionalAdhesionMolecule2022}. This thesis also shows that \nMAina
cells, after emerging as daughter cells from \MAina, not only lose adhesion
factor expression but also exhibit increased survival during IL-6 deprivation,
potentially aiding survival in circulation.


\textbf{\textit{Intermediary Conclusion:} Available Evidence of Adhesion
      Phenotypes Lacks Functional Characterization and Proof of Dramatypic
      Transitions:} The concept of changing adhesion dramatypes is supported by the
existence of distinct BM niches and the identification of separable adhesion
phenotypes. However, most transitions between these phenotypes during
dissemination are unexplored. Functional characterization of adhesive phenotypes
and their transitions could provide a robust framework for understanding
dissemination as a multistep process, reinforcing the dynamic adhesion
hypothetical framework. Mapping adhesive properties for each involved niche
could aid this endeavor.




\textbf{Considerations for Research on Myeloma Cell Adhesion:}
The evidence presented here sets the stage for a more detailed exploration of
adhesion factors in MM. Characterizations of bulk myeloma will not capture
the dynamic changes in adhesion factor expression that occur during dissemination.
Studying adhesion factors in MM \textit{in vitro} requires considering the
specific microenvironmental context. Some adhesion factors are not present in MM
cells but can be rapidly expressed with appropriate signals. Also, further
studies should differentiate between initial adhesion and upregulated adhesion
factors. For example, performing a \ac{WPSC} assay after 30 minutes of adhesion
could separate \INA cells based on initial adhesion capability, with RNAseq of
\nMAina \textit{vs} \MAina identifying initial adhesion factors. This
differentiation could be crucial for predicting colonization potential across
niches, as initial adhesion is likely to be essential for subsequent growth in
\ac{BM} or extramedullary environments.


\textbf{Implications for Therapy:}
Adhesion molecules have been targeted for therapy for over a decade
\cite{nairChapterSixEmerging2012, neriTargetingAdhesionMolecules2012}.
Especially inhibiting adhesion molecules involved in interaction with the
endothelium effectively reduces tumor burden in mouse models
\cite{asosinghUniquePathwayHoming2001a,
mrozikTherapeuticTargetingNcadherin2015}. A deeper understanding of how myeloma
cells regulate \ac{CAD} could be key to predicting and preventing dissemination.
Changing adhesion dramatypes suggests that different adhesion factors should be
either antagonized or agonized depending on their role. For instance, adhesion
factors involved in intravasation and extravasation should be antagonized, while
those facilitating BM retention\footretentiveadhesionfactors should be
agonized\,\textemdash\autoref{tab:1} provides a list of potential retention
targets. However, care should be taken to not agonize adhesion factors that also
provide survival signals.


\textbf{\textit{Concluding Remarks and Future Directions:}} The exploration of
changing adhesion dramatypes across various niches reveals a complex interplay
between myeloma cells and their environments, characterized by dynamic
regulation of adhesion factors. This supports the hypothesis that myeloma cells
adapt their adhesion dramatype in response to different microenvironments
encountered during dissemination, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies
targeting these specific adhesion mechanisms.

Distinguishing adhesion dramatypes among vascular, bone marrow, and
extramedullary niches highlights the need for targeted therapy to either promote
retention or prevent dissemination. Identifying bone marrow retentive factors
that do not induce survival signaling is crucial \dashed{such as CXCR4 or CXCL12},
with the gene-list in \apdxref{subapdx:tabs}{tab:S1} providing a strong starting
point.

Future research should focus on clarifying the functional roles and transitions
of these adhesion dramatypes through functional adhesion assays and live-cell
imaging. This will validate the changing adhesion dramatype hypothesis and
identify therapeutic targets to disrupt dissemination at various stages.
Controlled \textit{in vitro} studies simulating specific microenvironments,
integrating RNA sequencing and live-cell imaging, will enhance understanding of
adhesion factor regulation and inform the development of precise interventions
for multiple myeloma management.

\unnsubsection{\cadplasticitytitle}%
\label{sec:discussion_caddadaptability}%
Chapter\,1 presented the intriguing observation of rapid \ac{CAD} changes:
Within 24 hours, \INA cells adapted their \ac{CAD} from homotypic aggregation to
\ac{MSC} adhesion, then back to aggregation, followed by detachment of single
cells. Since \INA were isolated from highly advanced \ac{PCL}
\cite{burgerGp130RasMediated2001}, this rapid \ac{CAD} plasticity could be
driving an aggressive phenotype of myeloma.



\textbf{Associating Adhesion Factors with Disease Progression \& Aggressiveness:}
The hypothesis of rapid \ac{CAD} plasticity is predicated on the association
between adhesion factors and cancer aggressiveness. The transformative processes
in MM pathogenesis have been recognized for decades, typically observed over
months or years \cite{hallekMultipleMyelomaIncreasing1998}. Much of this
research has focused on transformations in resistance mechanisms acquired during
chemotherapy, with cell adhesion factors being well-established drivers of
survival signaling via NF-$\kappa$B and the selection of drug-resistant myeloma
clones \cite{landowskiCellAdhesionmediatedDrug2003,
      solimandoDrugResistanceMultiple2022}.


Recent research has provided detailed characterizations of adhesion factors
driving myeloma aggressiveness. For instance, adhesion and migration have been
associated with key regulators of myeloma progression%
\footnotequote{A total of 28 genes were then computationally predicted to be
      master regulators (MRs) of MM progression. HMGA1 and PA2G4 were validated
      \textit{in vivo} [...], indicating their role in MM progression and
      dissemination. Loss of HMGA1 and PA2G4 also compromised the proliferation,
      migration, and adhesion abilities of MM cells \textit{in
            vitro}.}{shenProgressionSignatureUnderlies2021}%
\cite{shenProgressionSignatureUnderlies2021}.%
Additionally, a recent study identified 18 adhesion factors as the basis for a
prognostic model to identify high-risk variants in newly diagnosed MM patients
\cite{huDevelopmentCellAdhesionbased2024}.

This thesis contributes to this field by showing that bone-retentive adhesion
factors and \ac{ECM} proteins are continuously downregulated during \ac{MGUS},
\ac{aMM}, \ac{MM}, and \ac{MMR}. Other studies of bulk myeloma biopsies confirm
changes in adhesion factor expression at some point between \ac{MGUS} and
\ac{PCL}%
\footnotequote{Patients with NDMM had increased VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 compared with
      MGUS and sMM patients. [...] MM patients at first relapse had increased levels
      of ICAM-1 and L-selectin, even compared with NDMM patients and had increased
      levels of VCAM-1 compared with MGUS and
      sMM.}{terposIncreasedCirculatingVCAM12016}%

      CD38 ($P$ < 0.001). Additionally, HLA-I and $\beta$2-microglobulin were
      abnormally highly expressed in MGUS, while CD40 expression was decreased in MM
      and PCL ($P$ < 0.05). Interestingly, a progressive increase in the soluble
      levels of $\beta$2-microglobulin was found from MGUS to MM and PCL patients ($P$
      < 0.03). In contrast, all groups showed similar surface and soluble amounts of
      CD126, CD130 and CD95, except for increased soluble levels of CD95 observed in
      PCL.}{perez-andresClonalPlasmaCells2005},~%

no changes in CD130 %
\cite{terposIncreasedCirculatingVCAM12016, perez-andresClonalPlasmaCells2005}.

Intriguingly, not only the surface expression of adhesion factors plays a role
during progression, but also the surrounding \ac{ECM}. \ac{ECM} from myeloma
patients exhibits tumor-promoting properties, in stark contrast to the
tumor-abrogating \ac{ECM} from healthy donors
\cite{ibraheemBMMSCsderivedECMModifies2019}.

Together, recent advances have effectively associated changes in cell adhesion
expression phenotypes with aggressive myeloma. Further insights can be drawn
from the databases used in Chapter\,1
\cite{seckingerCD38ImmunotherapeuticTarget2018}, identifying adhesion genes
differentially expressed between cohorts of different disease stages, followed by
functional categorization into GO-terms associated with dissemination steps.
However, these studies do not focus on a mechanistic understanding of how cell
adhesion drives aggressive dissemination, nor do they discuss the speed of
adaptations in adhesion phenotypes.


\textbf{\ac{CAD} Plasticity and Speed:}
Clonal dynamics have established that rapid mutations can drive aggressive
progression on a genomic scale \cite{keatsClonalCompetitionAlternating2012,
      eversPrognosticValueExtracellular2023}. The hypothesis of \ac{CAD} plasticity
extends this idea to the activity of adhesion factors, encompassing dynamic
(post-)transcriptional regulation and adhesion kinetics regulated at the protein
level. In solid cancers, sufficient information on regulatory dynamics exists to
train deep learning models that infer transcriptional changes over time from
static single-cell RNAseq data \cite{tongLearningTranscriptionalRegulatory2023}.
This study demonstrates that dynamic phenotypic changes can be projected along
\ac{EMT} and MET (Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition) trajectories, aiding in
the prediction of future detachment dynamics.


However, for hematological cancers such as MM, high time resolutions of up to minutes or
even seconds might be required. The speed of phenotypic changes is often an
overlooked dimension in molecular cancer research%
\footnotequote{These predominant snapshot approaches are fundamental limiting
      factors in the advancement of precision oncology since they are causal
      agnostic, i.e., they remove the notion of time (dynamics) from cancer
      datasets. [...] The lack of time-series measurements in single-cell
      multi-omics (e.g., gene expression dynamics, protein oscillations, histone
      marks spreading, etc.) and cell population fluctuations (i.e., ecological
      dynamics), in patient-derived tumor and liquid biopsies, remains a central
      roadblock in reconstructing cancer networks as complex dynamical
      systems.%
}{uthamacumaranReviewMathematicalComputational2022}
\cite{uthamacumaranReviewMathematicalComputational2022}. The author hypothesizes
that this rapidness is crucial for colonizing new sites. \ac{CAD} plasticity
alone might not be sufficient for successful attachment or survival: \INA cells
failed to adhere to \ac{MSC} during live-cell imaging if the motorized stage top
was moving too fast, necessitating decelerated microscopy configuration (data
not shown). This indicates that colonization attempts are thwarted by
fast-moving environments, despite strong \ac{MSC} adhesion potential.

Similar to Hypothesis\,1, the evidence for this hypothesis is limited by the
current understanding of transitions between adhesion dramatypes. Hypothesizing
the rapidity of such transitions adds further complexity, requiring a
time-dimension for every experiment. Nonetheless, there is evidence of rapid
transitions towards detaching and invasive dramatypes, implying swiftness in
these processes: A sudden loss of the adhesion factor CD138 can
occur either through antibody treatment or shedding by heparanase
\cite{yangHeparanasePromotesSpontaneous2005,
      akhmetzyanovaDynamicCD138Surface2020}. Exploring such rapid dynamisms is a major
challenge for future research but also presents a significant opportunity to
establish a new field of research in myeloma dissemination focused on \ac{CAD}.


\textbf{Potential Mechanisms Facilitating the Fast Switch of Adhesion Dramatypes:}
The hypothesis of rapid \ac{CAD} plasticity suggests that aggressive myeloma
cells can swiftly alter their adhesion dramatype, as observed in \INA-\ac{MSC}
co-cultures. To facilitate such rapid changes, several molecular mechanisms
might be utilized: Integrins can undergo rapid conformational changes from
active to inactive forms, a process used to detach B-cell leukemia cells through
small molecule treatment \cite{ruanVitroVivoEffects2022}. Additionally, myeloma
cells can express proteases like heparanase to shed adhesion factors from their
cell surface \cite{yangHeparanasePromotesSpontaneous2005}.

For \INA cells, the author proposes two mechanisms that could explain this
swiftness: First, NF-$\kappa$B signaling is enriched in \MAina cells.
NF-$\kappa$B is known as one of the fastest signaling pathways, capable of
regulating the transcription of target genes within seconds
\cite{gallego-sellesFastRegulationNFkB2022,
      zarnegarNoncanonicalNFkBActivation2008}. This signaling pathway is relevant for
both \textit{in vitro} experiments and MM patients
\cite{sarinEvaluatingEfficacyMultiple2020}, making its downstream effectors
robust targets for treatment.

Second, asymmetric cell division could explain the rapid loss of adhesion gene
mRNA transcripts observed in \nMAina cells that emerged from \MAina cells
through cell division. This process was popularized by stem cell research for
facilitating self-renewal \cite{shenghuiMechanismsStemCell2009}, yet its
underlying molecular mechanisms are conserved in asymmetrically dividing
cells and cellular polarization processes as well \cite{inabaAsymmetricStemCell2012,
      stjohnstonCellPolarityEggs2010}. Asymmetry can be established
\emph{intrinsically}, where factors are segregated between daughter cells, or
\emph{extrinsically}, by placing two daughters into distinct microenvironments
\cite{inabaAsymmetricStemCell2012}. It is debatable whether the definition of
extrinsic asymmetric cell division is fulfilled by this work’s observation of
\nMAina daughter cells emerging out of range of \acp{MSC}, thereby delaying
direct adhesion until the \nMAina re-attaches to an \ac{MSC}.

Intrinsic mechanisms could be explored by live-cell imaging of cell division
events in \INA-\ac{MSC} co-cultures, followed by \textit{in situ} hybridization
using fluorescently labeled antisense RNA probes. If successful, this could
represent the first evidence for asymmetric cell division in MM, which could be
useful for the popular \emph{cancer stem cell hypothesis}. However, \MAina cells
do not currently fulfill the multipotency criterion required by stem cell
terminology \cite{johnsenMyelomaStemCell2016, liAsymmetricCellDivision2022}.



\textbf{Implications for Research on Myeloma Cell Adhesion:}
Rapid \ac{CAD} plasticity could explain the high variance of adhesion factor
expression observed in myeloma patients. For instance, the interquartile range
of CXCL12 fold-change expression spans more than one order of magnitude
(Chapter\,1, \autoref{fig:6}). Even within a single disease stage and niche,
subsets of myeloma cells could exhibit rapidly interchanging adhesion dramatypes.
This underscores the relevance of \textit{in vitro} studies involving direct
contact with stromal or endothelial cells, as they can capture subpopulations
with different adhesion dramatypes, akin to \MAina and \nMAina.

Rapid \ac{CAD} plasticity also explains the paradoxical trend of decreasing
expression of retentive adhesion factors\footref{foot:retentiveadhesionfactor} during disease progression, as
described in Chapter\,1. Myeloma cells with the ability to rapidly switch
adhesion dramatypes benefit from this capability in several ways. They can lose
adhesion factors to facilitate release into circulation, and then quickly
upregulate these factors when needed for colonization. This dynamic switching
supports both survival signaling and the detachment of less adhesive cells,
providing a competitive advantage in various microenvironments.


\textbf{Implications for Therapy:}
Rapid \ac{CAD} plasticity could significantly impact the development of targeted
therapies: Different myeloma dramatypes might lack traditional prognostic
markers but still possess the ability to rapidly express these markers,
potentially leading to the misidentification of high-risk patients. Therefore,
targeted therapies should incorporate multiple markers obtained from various
tissue sources to enhance the accuracy of prognostic predictions. This
dynamic approach could ensure that high-risk patients receive the most
appropriate therapeutic interventions.



\textbf{\textit{Concluding Remarks:}} The hypothesis of rapid \ac{CAD}
plasticity is supported by the association between adhesion factors and myeloma
aggressiveness, although direct evidence for the speed of these adaptations
remains limited. Advanced stages of myeloma and aggressive phenotypes are linked
to distinct adhesion dramatypes. The scarce evidence of dramatype transitions
only imply rapidness, lacking precise dynamics require. If proven true, this
hypothesis underscores the need for future research to focus on the mechanisms
and speed of these adhesion changes to develop robust personalised therapies.

\unnsubsection{\caddtriggertitle}%
\label{sec:discussion_caddtrigger}%

biological implications:
- Different cues could trigger different adhesional changes
- Soluble signals?
- Detachment through intercellular effects: cell division, Saturation of hMSC adhesion surface%
- Detachment with mechanical influence: External forces and instability after aggregate size%
-


why is this important?
The cues that trigger the detachment of MM cells are not well understood. It
could be that MM cells detach due to a combination of factors, such as loss of
adhesion factors, changes in the BM microenvironment, or cell division or
even completely random. Knowing specific dissemination signals helps preventing
dissemination.


Papers like \citet{akhmetzyanovaDynamicCD138Surface2020} make it seem as if
there is one molecule that decides if a myeloma cell is circulating or not.

It's less about one clear (molecular) mechanism that decides that a myeloma cell
decides to become a disseminating cell, but rather a indirect consequence of a
combination of many processes.
These processes are:
- Loss of adhesion factors or dynamic expression of adhesion factors
- Loss of dependency from bone marrow microenvironment
- asdf

Our thesis postulates that there is no big switch that decides if a myeloma cell
detaches from the bone marrow, but rather a prolonged process of continuisly
downregulating adhesion factors, a dynamic upregulation of adhesion factors when
they're needed, but the ultimate event that triggers release is better
explained by external mechanical forces intercellular effects (cell division,
saturation of adhesive surface and rising instability of aggregates after
reaching a minimum size).

Detachment is triggered by external mechanical forces on cell
conglomerates previously sensitized by changes in cell adhesion behaviour

                        \cite{aggarwalChemokinesMultipleMyeloma2006,

How can this be studied?

Identifying such signals might be challenging without
having understood the other two hypotheses about adaptability first.




What new implications do these dimensions have on targeting adhesion factors for
therapy?


- It could represent a valid strategy to
strengthen myeloma adhesion, provided that targeted adhesion molecule is proven
to not be involved in other steps of dissemination, such as extravasation.
Stimulating adhesion factor expression or activity is harder than inhibition,
yet not impossible. For instance, the short polypeptide SP16 can activate the
receptor LRP1 \dashed{its high expression being associated with improved
      survival of MM patients in this work}, showing promising results during phase I
clinical trial \cite{wohlfordPhaseClinicalTrial2021}, but could potentially
increase survival of MM through PI3K/Akt signaling
\cite{potereDevelopingLRP1Agonists2019, heinemannInhibitingPI3KAKT2022} -

- One could also accept that many cues are simply not controllable, and hope for
systemic therapies like CAR- T Cells

%       from this Work}
% \label{sec:discussion_potential_breakthroughs}
% As an Outlook, the Author lists research topics arising from this work that have

% \textbf{Anti tumor effects of MSCs:}
% This thesis has discussed the pro-tumor effects of MSCs. However, MSCs have also
% been shown to have anti-tumor effects \cite{galderisiMyelomaCellsCan2015}. This

% \textbf{Lists of Adhesion Gene Associated With Prolonged Patient Survival:}
% The author lists adhesion genes that are associated with prolonged patient
% survival. These genes are highly expressed in myeloma samples from patients with
% longer overall

% At this time we could be on the verge of a new era of myeloma therapy,
% including bi-specific antibodies and cell based approaches
% \cite{moreNovelImmunotherapiesCombinations2023,
%       engelhardtFunctionalCureLongterm2024}. Currently, available CAR-T Cell therapies
% (ide-cel, cilta-cel) are extremely expensive, but show complete remission rates
% of up to \SI{80}{\percent} and a 18-month progression free survival rate of
% \SI{66}{\percent} \cite{bobinRecentAdvancesTreatment2022}. An affordable
% ``off-the-shelf'' CAR-T Cell product could become reality since the problem of
% deadly graft-versus-host disease during allogeneic transplantation seems to be
% solvable \cite{qasimMolecularRemissionInfant2017}, hence, research groups and
% biotech companies are racing towards developing a safe allogeneic CAR-T Cell
% technology \cite{depilOfftheshelfAllogeneicCAR2020}.


% the list of genes could be good targets because the BM niche is highly hypoxic,
% car t cells are not well, but directing them to the BM niche could increase
% efficacy.


% \textbf{Find MSC and Myeloma crosstalk:}
% Do another GSEA analysis using the list from factors upregulated in
% \citet{dotterweichContactMyelomaCells2016}, since there, \INA and primary
% \ac{hMSC} were used as well. Redoing an analysis with the background of the
% associated procceses gained here could reveal insights on the communication
% between \ac{hMSC} and \INA cells.

How does limited understanding of one dimension prevent the understanding of the
other dimensions?

Location \& Progression: If we don't know the expression profile of an MM cell
depending on their

source, results become incomparable.

Location \& Cues: If we don't know the cues that trigger detachment, we can't
predict where the MM cells will detach.
