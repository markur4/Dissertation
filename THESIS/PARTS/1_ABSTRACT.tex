% Abstract 1st paper (AACR):
% Multiple myeloma involves early dissemination of malignant plasma
% cells across the bone marrow; however, the initial steps of
% dissemination remain unclear. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
% stromal cells (hMSCs) stimulate myeloma cell expansion (e.g., IL-6)
% and simultaneously retain myeloma cells via chemokines (e.g., CXCL12)
% and adhesion factors. Hence, we hypothesized that the imbalance
% between cell division and retention drives dissemination. 

% We present an in vitro model using primary hMSCs co-cultured with
% INA-6 myeloma cells. Time-lapse microscopy revealed proliferation and
% attachment/detachment dynamics. Separation techniques (V-well adhesion
% assay and well plate sandwich centrifugation) were established to
% isolate MSC-interacting myeloma subpopulations that were characterized
% by RNAseq, cell viability and apoptosis. Results were correlated with
% gene expression data (n=837) and survival of myeloma patients (n=536). 

% On dispersed hMSCs, INA-6 saturate hMSC-surface before proliferating
% into large homotypic aggregates, from which single cells detached
% completely. On confluent hMSCs, aggregates were replaced by strong
% heterotypic hMSC-INA-6 interactions, which modulated apoptosis
% time-dependently. Only INA-6 daughter cells (nMA-INA6) detached from
% hMSCs by cell division but sustained adherence to hMSC-adhering mother
% cells (MA-INA6).

% Isolated nMA-INA6 indicated hMSC-autonomy through superior viability
% after IL­6 withdrawal and upregulation of proliferation-related genes.
% MA-INA6 upregulated adhesion and retention factors (CXCL12), that,
% intriguingly, were highly expressed in myeloma samples from patients
% with longer overall and progression-free survival, but their
% expression decreased in relapsed myeloma samples. 

% Altogether, in vitro dissemination of INA-6 is driven by detaching
% daughter cells after a cycle of hMSC-(re)attachment and proliferation,
% involving adhesion factors that represent a bone marrow-retentive
% phenotype with potential clinical relevance.


% Summary 2nd paper (JOSS):
% plotastic addresses the challenges of transitioning from exploratory
% data analysis to hypothesis testing in Python’s data science ecosystem.
% Bridging the gap between seaborn and pingouin, this library offers a
% unified environment for plotting and statistical analysis. It simplifies
% the workflow with a user-friendly syntax and seamless integration with
% familiar seaborn parameters (y, x, hue, row, col). Inspired by seaborn’s
% consistency, plotastic utilizes a DataAnalysis object to intelligently
% pass parameters to pingouin statistical functions. The library
% systematically groups the data according to the needs of statistical
% tests and plots, conducts visualisation, analyses and supports extensive
% customization options. In essence, plotastic establishes a protocol for
% configuring statical analyses through plotting parameters. This approach
% streamlines the process, translating seaborn parameters into statistical
% terms, allowing researchers to focus on correct statistical testing and
% less about specific syntax and implementations.

% Statement of need 2nd paper (JOSS):
% Python’s data science ecosystem provides powerful tools for both
% visualization and statistical testing. However, the transition from
% exploratory data analysis to hypothesis testing can be cumbersome,
% requiring users to switch between libraries and adapt to different
% syntaxes.

% seaborn has become a popular choice for plotting in Python, offering an
% intuitive interface. Its statistical functionality focuses on
% descriptive plots and bootstrapped confidence intervals (Waskom, 2021).
% The library pingouin offers an extensive set of statistical tests, but
% it lacks integration with common plotting capabilities (Vallat, 2018).
% statannotations integrates statistical testing with plot annotations,
% but uses a complex interface and is limited to pairwise comparisons
% (Charlier et al., 2022).

% plotastic addresses this gap by offering a unified environment for
% plotting and statistical analysis. With an emphasis on user-friendly
% syntax and integration with familiar seaborn parameters, it simplifies
% the process for users already comfortable seaborn. The library ensures a
% smooth workflow, from data import to hypothesis testing and
% visualization
