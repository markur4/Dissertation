\def\imagefeatures{%
    \emph{Features} are structural elements of an image, such as edges, corners,
    directions, colors. These features are mathematically extractable using
    \emph{filters} \dashed{also referred to as \emph{convolution
            kernels}}, which are functions or algorithms applied to the pixel values of
    an image. For instance, \emph{gabor filters} can extract edges of one
    particular direction, resulting in an image of the same size as the input,
    but showing only edges of one direction. \emph{Feature extraction} is the
    process of applying multiple filters, resulting in a stack of filtered
    images called a feature vector. \cite{szeliskiFeatureDetectionMatching2011,
        guptaDeepLearningImage2019} }

\def\cnn{%
    \emph{Convolutional neural networks} (CNN) are algorithms that use the output of a
    feature extractor\footref{foot:image_features} to feed
    into a neural network. The network then learns to associate these feature
    vectors with a label, such as \emph{cell} or \emph{background}. This is called
    \emph{supervised learning}.

\newcommand{\footinteractionscenario}{%
      \emph{Cell Interaction Scenario} (specified in this work): The type of
      cellular interactions and adhesions between cells of the same type
      (homotypic interaction), different types (heterotypic interaction), or between cells
      and the substrate. Complex interaction scenarios can combine all these
      types at the same time. When interaction scenarios emerge from cell
      division, the term \emph{growth conformation} can be used as well (see
      Chapter\,1)%

% \newcommand{\footcadd}{%

%       \ac{CADD} expands traditional \emph{cell adhesion} by a time component and
%       implies an intention to predict the timepoint of detachment
%       events. Such focus on dynamics is especially relevant for suspension cells
%       that exhibit intricate adhesion behaviors, that can not be explained by
%       cell attachment alone. %

\newcommand{\footdramatype}{%
      Environmental influences from the fertilization of an egg [...] through to
      sexual maturity are referred to as the primary milieu. The interaction
      between this milieu and the genotype will give rise to the phenotype. The
      phenotypical properties will subsequently be influenced by the
      pre-experiment conditions which are referred to as the secondary milieu.
      As a result, the dramatype is formed. Furthermore the laboratory animal
      will be affected by experimental procedures and treatments known as the
      tertiary milieu. %
