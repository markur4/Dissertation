% \textbf{Time as a Key Parameter:}
The area Thermodynamics of started with scientists measuring how long it takes
for gases to cool down. The author claims, by measuring the time it takes for
cancer cells to detach could lead to breakthroughs in research of myeloma
dissemination.

Time also follows this thesis like a red thread, in the form of handling it
as another dimension during data analysis, the microscopic time-dependent
changes in cell adhesion and detachment events, or the highly dynamic
interactions proposed in the steps of multiple myeloma dissemination.
