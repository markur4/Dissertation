% This thesis explored the complex interactions between myeloma cells and
% mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) through an interdisciplinary approach combining
% in vitro modeling, live-cell imaging, and semi-automated data analysis using
% Python. The research aimed to develop a detailed understanding of myeloma cell
% dissemination, focusing on dynamic adhesion behaviors and the role of the
% microenvironment.

% Unified Themes and Achievements

% The work consistently highlighted the dynamic nature of myeloma cell adhesion.
% The concept of “adhesion dramatypes” emerged as a unifying theme, describing how
% myeloma cells rapidly change their adhesion states in response to their
% environment. This plasticity was evident in the transitions observed in INA
% cells, which quickly moved between homotypic aggregation, adhesion to MSCs, and
% back to aggregation and detachment. The studies demonstrated that myeloma cells
% adapt their adhesion mechanisms rapidly, which might contribute to their
% aggressive behavior and ability to disseminate.

% The aims initially defined were largely achieved. The thesis successfully
% developed an in vitro model to study myeloma-MSC interactions and provided a
% semi-automated analysis tool, Plotastic, to facilitate reproducible data
% analysis. The combination of live-cell imaging and RNA sequencing provided
% comprehensive insights into the behavior and gene expression profiles of myeloma
% cells, supporting the hypothesis of dynamic adhesion plasticity.

% Challenges and Solutions

% Several major challenges were encountered during the research. One significant
% challenge was the need to capture rapid, dynamic changes in cell adhesion, which
% required high time-resolution imaging and precise data analysis methods. This
% was addressed by developing specialized microscopy techniques and leveraging the
% computational power of Python for semi-automated analysis. The heterogeneity of
% myeloma cell behavior and the variability in adhesion factor expression posed
% another challenge, which was approached by focusing on detailed characterization
% of \dashed{only} one cell line and its different adhesion dramatypes and their transitions.

% Some challenges remain unresolved. For example, the precise mechanisms driving
% the rapid changes in adhesion phenotypes are not fully understood. While this
% work provides a foundation, further research is needed to explore the underlying
% signaling pathways and genetic factors in more detail. Additionally, the in
% vitro models, although informative, cannot fully replicate the complexity of the
% in vivo bone marrow environment.

% Future Outlook

% The findings from this thesis suggest several directions for future research and
% therapy. There is a need to develop more advanced in vitro models that better
% mimic the specific microenvironments myeloma cells encounter in the body.
% Integrating live-cell imaging with more sophisticated computational models could
% provide deeper insights into the dynamic interactions between myeloma cells and
% their environment.

% Therapeutically, targeting the dynamic adhesion properties of myeloma cells
% could offer new strategies to prevent dissemination. Personalized therapies that
% consider specific adhesion dramatypes and their transitions could improve
% treatment efficacy. Future research should also investigate the potential of
% combining adhesion-targeting therapies with existing treatments to enhance their
% effectiveness and reduce the risk of myeloma spreading.
