% From paper 1 (AACR): Multiple myeloma arises from clonal expansion of
% malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). At diagnosis, myeloma cells
% have disseminated to multiple sites in the skeleton and, in some cases, to
% “virtually any tissue” (1,2). However, the mechanism through which myeloma
% cells initially disseminate remains unclear.

% Dissemination is a multistep process involving invasion, intravasation,
% intravascular arrest, extravasation, and colonization (3). To initiate
% dissemination, myeloma cells overcome adhesion, retention, and dependency on
% the BM microenvironment, which could involve the loss of adhesion factors such
% as CD138 (4,5). BM retention is mediated by multiple factors: First,
% chemokines (CXCL12 and CXCL8) produced by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs),
% which attract plasma cells and prime their cytoskeleton and integrins for
% adhesion (6,7). Second, myeloma cells must overcome the anchorage and physical
% boundaries of the extracellular matrix (ECM), consisting of e.g. fibronectin,
% collagens, and proteoglycans such as decorin (8–11). Simultaneously, ECM
% provides signals inducing myeloma cell cycle arrest or progression the cell
% cycle (8,11). ECM is also prone to degradation, which is common in several
% osteotropic cancers, and is the cause of osteolytic bone disease. This is
% driven by a ‘vicious cycle’ that maximizes bone destruction by extracting
% growth factors (EGF and TGF-β) that are stored in calcified tissues (12).
% Third, direct contact with MSCs physically anchors myeloma cells to the BM
% (3,13). Fourth, to disseminate to distant sites, myeloma cells require, at
% least partially, independence from essential growth and survival signals
% provided by MSCs in the form of soluble factors or cell adhesion signaling
% (5,14,15). For example, the VLA4 (Myeloma)–VCAM1 (MSC)-interface activates
% NF-κB in both myeloma and MSCs, inducing IL-6 expression in MSCs. The
% independence from MSCs is then acquired through autocrine survival signaling
% (16,17). In short, anchorage of myeloma cells to MSCs or ECM is a
% ‘double-edged sword’: adhesion counteracts dissemination, but also presents
% signaling cues for growth, survival, and drug resistance (18).

% To address this ambiguity, we developed an in vitro co-culture system modeling
% diverse adhesion modalities to study dissemination, growth, and survival of
% myeloma cells and hMSCs. Co-cultures of hMSCs and the myeloma cell line INA-6
% replicated tight interactions and aggregate growth, akin to "microtumors" in
% Ghobrial’s metastasis concept (19). We characterized the growth conformations
% of hMSCs and INA­6 as homotypic aggregation vs. heterotypic hMSC adherence and
% their effects on myeloma cell survival. We tracked INA­6 detachments from
% aggregates and hMSCs, thereby identifying a potential "disseminated"
% subpopulation lacking strong adhesion. We developed innovative techniques
% (V-well adhesion assay and well plate sandwich centrifugation) to separate
% weakly and strongly adherent subpopulations for the subsequent analysis of
% differential gene expression and cell survival. Notably, our strategy resolves
% the differences in gene expression and growth behavior between cells of one
% cell population in "direct" contact with MSCs. In contrast, previous methods
% differentiated between "direct" and "indirect" cell-cell contact using
% transwell inserts (20). To evaluate whether genes mediating adhesion and
% growth characteristics of INA-6 were associated with patient survival, we
% analyzed publicly available datasets (21,22).

\unnsubsection{Multiple Myeloma and Other Monoclonal Gammopathies}%
\label{sec:intro_myeloma}%
\ac{MM} is a hematological malignancy characterized by the
clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells primarily within multiple sites of
the \ac{BM}. This cancer arises from plasma cells, the
antibody-producing cells of the immune system, which undergo malignant
transformation resulting in uncontrolled growth and disruption of normal bone
marrow function \cite{yangPathogenesisTreatmentMultiple2022}. The prevalence of
multiple myeloma has tripled across both europe and USA from 1980 to 2014 due to
an ageing population \cite{ociasTrendsHematologicalCancer2016,
    turessonRapidlyChangingMyeloma2018}. For 2024, 35780 new \ac{MM} cases and 12540
deaths are estimated for the USA alone \cite{siegelCancerStatistics20242024}.

To understand the progression of a healthy plasma cell to \ac{MM}, one can
review other \emph{monoclonal gammopathies}. These are defined by the presence
of monoclonal immunoglobulin in the blood serum which is indicative of abnormal
plasma cell clones overexpressing the same type of dysfunctional antibody.
\cite{kyleMonoclonalGammopathyUndetermined1997,
    fermandMonoclonalGammopathyClinical2018}. When no further disease manifestations
are present, the condition is termed \acfi{MGUS}, which is the most commonly
diagnosed monoclonal gammopathy \cite{kyleMonoclonalGammopathyUndetermined1997}.
\ac{MGUS} has a 1-\SI{5}{\percent} annual risk of progression to \ac{MM}
\cite{rajkumarInternationalMyelomaWorking2014}.

To distinguish \ac{MM} from other monoclonal gammopathies, diagnosis of \ac{MM}
requires not only identification of a minimum of clonal plasma cells, but also a
\emph{myeloma defining event} which is evidence of malignancy or end-organ
damage, such as hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or bone lesions
\cite{rajkumarInternationalMyelomaWorking2014}. A localized
smaller\footnotequote{Solitary plasmacytoma with \SI{10}{\percent} or more
    clonal plasma cells is regarded as multiple myeloma. [...] If bone marrow has
    less than \SI{10}{\percent} clonal plasma cells, more than one bone lesion is
    required to distinguish [\ac{MM}] from solitary plasmacytoma with minimal marrow
    involvement.}{rajkumarInternationalMyelomaWorking2014} mass of clonal plasma
cells together with a singular primary bone lesion is diagnosed as \ac{SP}.
\ac{SP} can progress to \ac{MM} in \SI{32}{\percent} of cases with a median
follow-up of 9.7 years
\cite{thumallapallySolitaryPlasmacytomaPopulationbased2017,
    gaoSolitaryBonePlasmacytoma2024}. Studies from
\citet{kyleMonoclonalGammopathyUndetermined1997} show that \ac{SP} cases are
rare, constituting only \SI{2.5}{\percent} of monoclonal gammopathy diagnoses,
whereas \ac{MM} represent \SI{18}{\percent}. Another rare precursor of \ac{MM}
is \textit{smouldering} or \acfi{aMM}, representing \SI{3}{\percent} of
monoclonal gammopathies \cite{kyleMonoclonalGammopathyUndetermined1997}.
\ac{aMM} is diagnosed when no myeloma defining event is detected, although the
quantities of clonal plasma cells or monoclonal protein align with respective
criteria for \ac{MM} diagnosis. \cite{rajkumarInternationalMyelomaWorking2014}.
Recent reports show that if left untreated, \SI{72}{\percent} of \ac{aMM}
patients progress to \ac{MM}, whereas early treatment can lower the progression
rate to \SI{11}{\percent} within up to 7.6 years until last
follow-up\footnote{For non-high risk \ac{aMM} patients, treatment lowered
    \ac{MM} progression rate to \SI{9}{\percent}, compared to \SI{31}{\percent} for
    untreated patients (within up to 6.7 and 7.6 years of follow-up, respectively).
    For high-risk \ac{aMM} patiens, treatment lowered \ac{aMM} progression rate to
    \SI{11}{\percent}, compared to \SI{72}{\percent} for untreated patients (within
    up to 5.2 years of follow-up and median time to progression of 2.2 years,
    respectively) \cite{abdallahModeProgressionSmoldering2024}.}
\cite{abdallahModeProgressionSmoldering2024,
    mateosmaria-victoriaLenalidomideDexamethasoneHighRisk2013}. \ac{MM} itself can
progress to advanced stages, such as \emph{extramedullary involvement/disease}
which describes colonization of soft tissues outside the bone marrow
\cite{bladeExtramedullaryDiseaseMultiple2022}, but also \ac{PCL} which is
characterized by high levels of circulating plasma cells
\cite{jungUpdatePrimaryPlasma2022}. However, the most common cause of death is
renal failure during the \ac{MM} stage, caused by excess immunoglobulins or
hypercalcemia due to bone degradation \cite{kunduMultipleMyelomaRenal2022}.

With a 5-year surival rate of \SI{50}{\percent}
\cite{turessonRapidlyChangingMyeloma2018}, \ac{MM} can be considered incurable
and deadly. \ac{MM} relapses within the first year in \SI{16}{\percent} of
patients (\ac{MMR}), others face relapse at a later time or only continued
response to treatment \cite{majithiaEarlyRelapseFollowing2016}. Although
treatments have improved, the age-adjusted mortality rate of \ac{MM} has
decreased from 1999 to 2020 by only \SI{-1.6}{\percent}
\cite{doddiDisparitiesMultipleMyeloma2024}.
\citet{engelhardtFunctionalCureLongterm2024} describes the current standard care
for transplant-eligible newly diagnosed \ac{MM} patients as follows: Induction
with a CD38 antibody, proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory drug, and
dexamethasone, potentially followed by bone marrow transplantation and
lenalidomide maintenance \cite{rajkumarMultipleMyelomaCurrent2020}. A major
challenge to these treatments is the continued cycle of remission and relapse,
with each relapse generally being harder to treat
\cite{podarRelapsedRefractoryMultiple2021}. Development of such resistance is
well described in the literature, often arising from the intraclonal genetic
heterogeneity within the myeloma cell population and the protective niche
provided by the \ac{BMME}
\cite{solimandoDrugResistanceMultiple2022}.

\unnsubsection{Dissemination of Myeloma Cells}%
\label{sec:intro_myeloma_dissemination}%
As the name suggests, \emph{multiple} myeloma involves spreading of clonal
plasma cells in multiple sites within the body, a process that's described with
the term \emph{dissemination}. Although a single large plasmacytoma is still
classified as \ac{MM} \cite{rajkumarInternationalMyelomaWorking2014}, the
presence of multiple tumor lesions within the \ac{BM} is very common. More than
one or 25 such lesions predict poor prognosis for asymptomatic and symptomatic
\ac{MM} patients, respectively \cite{kastritisPrognosticImportancePresence2014,
    maiMagneticResonanceImagingbased2015a}. Additionally, \ac{MM} cells can
disseminate to extramedullary sites of virtually any tissue, highlighting
\ac{MM} as a systemic disease with potential multi-organ impact
\cite{rajkumarMultipleMyelomaCurrent2020,
    bladeExtramedullaryDiseaseMultiple2022}. Hence, dissemination is a major
contributor to \ac{MM} progression and poor prognosis, enabling \ac{MM} cells to
colonize new niches that favor survival, quiescent states or are less accessible
for therapy, especially with high subclonal heterogeneity
\cite{forsterMolecularImpactTumor2022,keatsClonalCompetitionAlternating2012}.

Dissemination of \ac{MM} is reminiscent of \emph{metastasis}, a
term typically associated with solid tumors describing the spread of cancer
cells to distant sites. However, it substantially differs from metastasis due to
the hematological or ``liquid'' nature of \ac{MM}. Long-lived plasma cells originate
from migratory B-cells, negating the need for extensive transformative processes
such as \emph{epithelial to mesenchymal transition}, which is required for
escaping tightly connected solid tissues to enter the bloodstream
\cite{ribattiEpithelialMesenchymalTransitionCancer2020}. Although referred to as
``liquid tumor'', \ac{MM} cells still accumulate as distinct foci within the bone
marrow, somewhat mirroring the localized growth of solid tumors. This
characteristic has led to \ac{MM} being proposed as a model for studying solid
``micrometastases'' \cite{ghobrialMyelomaModelProcess2012}, highlighting its
unique blend of liquid and solid tumor properties and providing insights into
the mechanisms of cancer dissemination and colonization of new niches.

The exact mechanism of \ac{MM} dissemination is not entirely understood.
Nevertheless, attempts to structure this process have been made by
\citet{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020}, describing \ac{MM} dissemination in
five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Retention in the \ac{BM}
    \item Release from the \ac{BM}
    \item Intravasation
    \item Extravasation
    \item Colonization.
\end{enumerate}

% \emph{Retention in the \ac{BM}}, \emph{release from the \ac{BM}},
% \emph{intravasation}, \emph{extravasation}, and \emph{colonization}. 

According to \citet{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020}, \ac{MM}
dissemination begins with \ac{MM} cells overcoming retention and adhesion within
the \ac{BMME}. Following release, \ac{MM} cells undergo \emph{intravasation}
into the bloodstream, where they can circulate before extravasating into new
\ac{BM} sites. This migration is directed by chemokines and growth factors
produced by \ac{BM} cells. For instance, CXCL12 and IGF-1 are critical in
guiding \ac{MM} cells back to the \ac{BM}, a process called \emph{homing}
\cite{vandebroekExtravasationHomingMechanisms2008}. In the \ac{BM} they can
\emph{colonize} and form new tumor foci.

The review by \citet{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020} implies a
sequential order of such steps, yet direct proof of this is lacking. Still, the
review provides a framework that integrates multiple complex research topics
into one coherent context. For instance,
\citet{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020} states that two adhesive
processes are critical for succesful dissemination: Lowered adhesion to the \ac{BM},
but increased adhesion to the endothelium to initiate extravasation
\cite{asosinghUniquePathwayHoming2001a,
    mrozikTherapeuticTargetingNcadherin2015}. This alone implies stringent
separation of different adhesive processes during the dissemination process.
Given that \acp{CAM} have become attractive targets for
treating \ac{MM} \cite{bouzerdanAdhesionMoleculesMultiple2022,
    katzAdhesionMoleculesLifelines2010}, such detailed understanding of cell
adhesion is crucial for developing successful therapies.


% ======================================================================
% ======================================================================
\unnsubsection{Retention of Myeloma Cells in the Bone Marrow}%
\label{sec:intro_myeloma_retention}%
According to \citet{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020}, overcoming
retention and adhesion to the BME is critical to \ac{MM} dissemination. Retention of
plasma cells to the BME is mediated by multiple mechanisms, which are
categorized here into \emph{direct adhesion}, \emph{soluble survival factors}
and \emph{chemotaxis}. A fourth notable mechanism is the physical boundary that
is bone tissue and \ac{ECM}, which could become important for
\ac{MM} dissemination once degradation of bone tissue has progressed.

\emph{Direct adhesion} of \ac{MM} cells to the \ac{BM} is mediated through
\ac{ECM} components and cell adhesion to other \ac{BM} resident cells like
osteoblasts, osteoclasts and \acp{BMSC}
\cite{bouzerdanAdhesionMoleculesMultiple2022}. \ac{ECM} components include
fibronectin, collagens, and proteoglycans such as decorin
\cite{huDecorinmediatedSuppressionTumorigenesis2021,
    huangHigherDecorinLevels2015,katzAdhesionMoleculesLifelines2010,
    kiblerAdhesiveInteractionsHuman1998}. \acp{BMSC} are vital in this niche,
supporting cell adhesion through \acp{CAM} but also by secretion of (\ac{ECM})
components \cite{katzAdhesionMoleculesLifelines2010}. Such adhesion acts both as
physical anchorage but also provides signaling cues for growth, survival, and
drug resistance. A classic example is the binding of \ac{MM} cell integrins to
VCAM-1 on \acp{BMSC}, such as α4β1 (VLA-4)
\cite{bouzerdanAdhesionMoleculesMultiple2022}. Since direct adhesion promotes
both retention and tumour growth, it could play an ambiguous role during \ac{MM}
progression.

\emph{Soluble survival factors} contribute to \ac{BM} retention, since plasma
cells can not survive outside the bone marrow without them. For example,
deleting BCMA \dashedsentence{a receptor for survival factors} leads to loss of
\acp{BMPC}  due to unsustained maintenance of cell survival
\cite{oconnorBCMAEssentialSurvival2004}. Soluble survival factors include IL-6,
IGF-1, BAFF, APRIL, and VEGF, although IGF-1 has proven to be the primary
survival factor \cite{sprynskiRoleIGF1Major2009}. These signals are secreted by
\acp{BMSC} and adipocytes \cite{kiblerAdhesiveInteractionsHuman1998,
    garcia-ortizRoleTumorMicroenvironment2021}. \emph{Chemotaxis} is also crucial
for \ac{BM} retention. CXCL12 and CXCL8 are soluble chemotactic signals produced
by \acp{BMSC} and attract \ac{MM} cells, but also primes their cytoskeleton and
integrins for adhesion \cite{aggarwalChemokinesMultipleMyeloma2006,
    alsayedMechanismsRegulationCXCR42007}.

Together, \acp{BMSC} play a critical role in \ac{MM} retention, providing direct
adhesion, soluble survival factors, and chemotactic signals.

% ======================================================================
\unnsubsection{Release of Myeloma Cells from the Bone Marrow}%
\label{sec:intro_myeloma_release}%
\citet{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020} describes the release of myeloma
cells from the BME as all steps required for overcoming bone marrow retention,
but also putative triggers leading to migration out of the BME. To the author's
knowledge, release of \ac{MM} cells is the least understood within the dissemination
process. Still, initial results can be summarized, hinting at mechanisms that
could be involved in this process to better understand dissemination.

Loss of adhesion: While the specific microenvironmental stimuli regulating
this release are not fully defined, changes in the expression of \acp{CAM} play a
role. For example, circulating \ac{MM} cells show lower levels of integrin
$\alpha4\beta1$ compared to those residing in the \ac{BM}, implying a dynamic
downregulation of adhesion molecules for release
\cite{paivaDetailedCharacterizationMultiple2013,
    paivaCompetitionClonalPlasma2011}. On the other hand,
\citet{terposIncreasedCirculatingVCAM12016} reported increase in adhesion
molecule expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in patients with \ac{MM} compared to those
with \ac{MGUS} and \ac{aMM}. This further shows that regulation of \acp{CAM}
can depend both current microenvironmental factors and on the stage of the
disease.

Hence, adhesion molecules
can be ambiguous role during in \ac{MM} dissemination
and progression.

A study from \citet{akhmetzyanovaDynamicCD138Surface2020} presents CD138
(\textit{aka} Syndecan-1) as a potential \textit{switch} between adhesion and
release as treatment with a CD138 blocking antibody has been shown to rapidly
induce the mobilization of \ac{MM} cells from the \ac{BM} to peripheral blood in a mouse
model, suggesting that alterations in adhesion molecule expression facilitate \ac{MM}
cell release. \citet{brandlJunctionalAdhesionMolecule2022} builds on that
finding, showing that JAM-C inversely correlates with CD138 expression while
promoting \ac{MM} progression in a mouse model.



Notably, active degradation of bone tissue removes both adhesion to \ac{ECM}
components, but also physical boundaries for \ac{MM}
cells, allowing them to disseminate to other sites.
This process is driven by a
``vicious cycle'' that maximizes bone destruction by extracting growth factors
(EGF and TGF-β) stored in calcified tissues.



- Survival Factors:
\ac{MM} cells must become partially independent from
essential survival factors. This independence is acquired through autocrine
survival signaling, as exemplified by the VLA4 –VCAM1 -interface



- Loss of Retention:




- Hypoxia:
The hypoxic conditions within the \ac{BM} during \ac{MM} growth also influence cell
release. Hypoxia induces changes in \ac{MM} cell adherence to \acp{BMSC} and collagen,
which may facilitate their release from the \ac{BM} niche. Hypoxia-induced factors
like HIF-2α can decrease \ac{MM} cell responsiveness to stromal-derived CXCL12,
thereby disrupting the CXCR4/CXCL12 retention signal and facilitating \ac{MM} cell
release \cite{zeissigTumourDisseminationMultiple2020}.







% ======================================================================
% ======================================================================
\unnsubsection{MSCs: Mesenchymal Stromal (Stem) Cells}%
\label{sec:intro_hMSCs}%
The previous sections mentioned \acp{MSC} several times as \acp{BMSC}, being a
critical component of the \ac{BMME} in the context of multiple myeloma
\cite{mangoliniBoneMarrowStromal2020}. Before discussing their role in \ac{MM}
specifically, it is important to understand what \acp{MSC} are.

Explaining what an \ac{MSC} is, can be challenging. MSCs
are derived from multiple different sources, serve a wide array of functions and
are always isolated as a heterogenous group of cells. This makes it particularly
challenging to find a consensus on their exact definition, nomenclature, exact
function and \textit{in vivo} differentiation potential. Therefore, the
following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the biology of MSCs set within
a historical context.

\acp{MSC} first gained popularity as a stem cell. Stem cells lay the foundation
of multicellular organisms. Embryonic stem cells orchestrate the growth and
patterning during embryonic development, while adult stem cells are responsible
for regeneration during adulthood. The classical definition of a stem cell is
that of a relatively undifferentiated cell that divides asymmetrically,
producing another stem cell and a differentiated
cell~\cite{cooperCellMolecularApproach2000, shenghuiMechanismsStemCell2009}.
Because of their significance in biology and regenerative medicine, stem cells
have become a prominent subject in modern research. Especially (\acp{hMSC})
have proven to be a promising candidate in this
context~\cite{ullahHumanMesenchymalStem2015}.

\emph{Mesenchyme} first appears in embryonic development during gastrulation.
There, cells that are committed to a mesodermal fate, lose their cell junctions
and exit the epithelial layer in order to migrate freely. This process is called
epithelial-mesenchymal transition
\cite{tamFormationMesodermalTissues1987,nowotschinCellularDynamicsEarly2010}.
Hence, the term mesenchyme describes non-epithelial embryonic tissue
differentiating into mesodermal lineages such as bone, muscles and blood.
Interestingly, it was shown nearly twenty years earlier that cells within adult
bone marrow seemed to have mesenchymal properties as they were able to
differentiate into bone tissue
\cite{friedensteinOsteogenesisTransplantsBone1966,
    friedensteinOsteogenicPrecursorCells1971, biancoMesenchymalStemCells2014}. This
was the origin of the \emph{``mesengenic process''}-hypothesis: This concept
states that mesenchymal stem cells serve as progenitors for multiple mesodermal
tissues (bone, cartilage, muscle, marrow stroma, tendon, fat, dermis and
connective tissue) during both adulthood and embryonic
development~\cite{caplanMesenchymalStemCells1991,caplanMesengenicProcess1994}.
The mesenchymal nature of these cells (termed bone marrow stromal cells: \acp{BMSC})
was confirmed later when they were shown to differentiate into adipocytic (fat)
and chondrocytic (cartilage)
lineages~\cite{pittengerMultilineagePotentialAdult1999}. Since then, the term
\emph{``mesenchymal stem cell''} (MSC) has grown popular as an adult multipotent
precursor to a couple of mesodermal tissues. \acp{MSC} derived from bone marrow
(\acp{BMSC}) were shown to differentiate into osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes
and cardiomyocytes \cite{gronthosSTRO1FractionAdult1994,
    muruganandanAdipocyteDifferentiationBone2009, xuMesenchymalStemCells2004}. Most
impressively, these cells also exhibited ectodermal and endodermal
differentiation potential, as they produced neuronal cells, pancreatic cells and
hepatocytes \cite{barzilayLentiviralDeliveryLMX1a2009,
    wilkinsHumanBoneMarrowderived2009, gabrInsulinproducingCellsAdult2013,
    stockHumanBoneMarrow2014}.

It was later established that cultures with MSC-like
properties can be isolated from ``virtually every post-natal organs and
tissues'', and not just bone
marrow~\cite{dasilvameirellesMesenchymalStemCells2006}. However, depending on
which tissue they originated from, \acp{MSC} can differ greatly in their
transcription profile and \textit{in vivo} differentiation potential
\cite{jansenFunctionalDifferencesMesenchymal2010,sacchettiNoIdenticalMesenchymal2016}.

Since \acp{MSC} are a heterogenous group of cells, they were defined by their
\textit{in vitro} characteristics. A minimal set of criteria are the following
\cite{dominiciMinimalCriteriaDefining2006}: First, \acp{MSC} must be plastic
adherent. Second, they must express or lack a set of specific surface antigens
(positive for CD73, CD90, CD105; negative for CD45, CD34, CD11b, CD19). Third,
\acp{MSC} must differentiate to osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondroblasts \textit{in
    vitro}. Together, \acp{MSC} exhibit diverse differentiation potentials and can be
isolated from multiple sources of the body.

% TODO: Put this into a context of multiple myeloma
% This offers great opportunity for
% regenerative medicine, if the particular hMSC-subtype is properly characterized.

\unnsubsection{hMSC­--Myeloma Interactions}
\label{sec:intro_myeloma_hMSC}
As mentioned in previous sections, MSCs are key drivers of \ac{MM} pathology through
mediating retention and survival of \ac{MM} cells in the bone marrow
\cite{mangoliniBoneMarrowStromal2020}. Here, we outlay details of such
interactions and present further mechanisms how interactions between \ac{MM} and \acp{MSC}
contribute to \ac{MM} progression.

bone marrow microenvironment \ac{BMME}



it plays a

myeloma bone disease.

Bone is a two-phase system in which the mineral phase provides the stiffness and
the collagen fibers provide the ductility and ability to absorb
energy~\cite{viguet-carrinRoleCollagenBone2006}. On a molecular level, bone
tissue is composed of \ac{ECM} proteins that are calcified by
hydroxyapatite crystals. This \ac{ECM} consists mostly of collagen type I, but also
components with major regulatory activity, such as fibronectin and proteoglycans
that are essential for healthy bone
physiology~\cite{alcorta-sevillanoDecipheringRelevanceBone2020}. Bone tissue is
actively remodeled by bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-degrading osteoclasts.
Osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that reside in the
bone marrow~\cite{friedensteinOsteogenesisTransplantsBone1966,
    pittengerMultilineagePotentialAdult1999}. MSCs also give rise to adipocytes
(ACs) to form Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue (BMAT), which can account for up to
70\% of bone marrow volume~\cite{fazeliMarrowFatBone2013}.

\ac{MM} indirectly degrades bone tissue by stimulating osteoclasts and inhibiting
osteoblast differentiation, which leads to \ac{MM}-related bone disease
(MBD)~\cite{glaveyProteomicCharacterizationHuman2017}. MBD is present in 80\% of
patients at diagnosis and is characterized by osteolytic lesions, osteopenia and
pathological fractures~\cite{terposPathogenesisBoneDisease2018}.


from \cite{forsterMolecularImpactTumor2022}:
% """Even though the overall survival and response rate of MM patients have
% significantly improved due to the introduction of novel therapeutic agents, MM
% is still an incurable disease. Different studies have shown that the
% pathophysiology of MM is dynamically supported by strong and dynamic
% interactions with the surrounding microenvironment. Direct and indirect
% signaling pathways between malignant plasma cells and the TME can regulate
% plasma cell adhesion, cellular motility and the generation of new blood vessels.
% Additional factors such as hypoxia or nutrient-deprivation can further support
% the invasiveness of single plasma cell clones that finally enter the blood
% circulation. Cellular and non-cellular contents of the blood can improve the
% survival of disseminated plasma cells and facilitate the engraftment at distant
% body sites. Aside, acquisition of secondary mutations selects clones that are no
% longer dependent on the extrinsic support of the \ac{BM}. A better understanding of
% the complex interactions between the TME and MM cells might potentially lead to
% new therapeutic approaches and result in an improved progression-free survival
% with reduced risks for disease relapse or extramedullary dissemination. For this
% reason, the TME is a promising therapeutic target, especially for aggressive,
% recurrent and/or advanced disease stages. In order to specify the relevance of
% those therapeutic approaches, future studies must be carried out in a larger and
% multicenter setting."""
