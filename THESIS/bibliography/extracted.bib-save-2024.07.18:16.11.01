                   component of many computer vision applications.
                   Consider the two pairs of images shown in Figure 4.2.
                   For the first pair, we may wish to align the two
                   images so that they can be seamlessly stitched into a
                   composite mosaic (Chapter 9). For the second pair, we
                   may wish to establish a dense set of correspondences
                   so that a 3D model can be constructed or an
                   in-between view can be generated (Chapter 11). In
                   either case, what kinds of features should you detect
                   and then match in order to establish such an
                   alignment or set of correspondences? Think about this
                   for a few moments before reading on.},

  abstract =      {Artificial intelligence, deep convolutional neural
                   networks, and deep learning are all niche terms that
                   are increasingly appearing in scientific
                   presentations as well as in the general media. In
                   this review, we focus on deep learning and how it is
                   applied to microscopy image data of cells and tissue
                   samples. Starting with an analogy to neuroscience, we
                   aim to give the reader an overview of the key
                   concepts of neural networks, and an understanding of
                   how deep learning differs from more classical
                   approaches for extracting information from image
                   data. We aim to increase the understanding of these
                   methods, while highlighting considerations regarding
                   input data requirements, computational resources,
                   challenges, and limitations. We do not provide a full
                   manual for applying these methods to your own data,
                   but rather review previously published articles on
                   deep learning in image cytometry, and guide the
                   readers toward further reading on specific networks
                   and methods, including new methods not yet applied to
                   cytometry data. {\copyright} 2018 The Authors.
