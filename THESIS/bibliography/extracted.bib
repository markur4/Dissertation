                   component of many computer vision applications.
                   Consider the two pairs of images shown in Figure 4.2.
                   For the first pair, we may wish to align the two
                   images so that they can be seamlessly stitched into a
                   composite mosaic (Chapter 9). For the second pair, we
                   may wish to establish a dense set of correspondences
                   so that a 3D model can be constructed or an
                   in-between view can be generated (Chapter 11). In
                   either case, what kinds of features should you detect
                   and then match in order to establish such an
                   alignment or set of correspondences? Think about this
                   for a few moments before reading on.},

                   are increasingly appearing in scientific
                   presentations as well as in the general media. In
                   this review, we focus on deep learning and how it is
                   applied to microscopy image data of cells and tissue
                   samples. Starting with an analogy to neuroscience, we
                   aim to give the reader an overview of the key
                   concepts of neural networks, and an understanding of
                   how deep learning differs from more classical
                   approaches for extracting information from image
                   data. We aim to increase the understanding of these
                   methods, while highlighting considerations regarding
                   input data requirements, computational resources,
                   challenges, and limitations. We do not provide a full
                   manual for applying these methods to your own data,

                   malignancy in hematological tumors. The pathogenesis
                   of MM is complex with high heterogeneity, and the
                   development of the disease is a multistep process.
                   Chromosomal translocations, aneuploidy, genetic
                   mutations, and epigenetic aberrations are essential
                   in disease initiation and progression. The
                   correlation between MM cells and the bone marrow
                   microenvironment is associated with the survival,
                   progression, migration, and drug resistance of MM
                   cells. In recent decades, there has been a
                   significant change in the paradigm for the management
                   of MM. With the development of proteasome inhibitors,
                   immunomodulatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies,
                   chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, and novel
                   agents, the survival of MM patients has been

                   acts as both a nanocarrier and a treatment tool for
                   MM. The properties and responsive conditions of
                   nanomedicine can be tailored to reach different
                   goals. Nanomedicine with a precise targeting property

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: The number of hematological malignancies
                   is expected to increase as the Danish population ages
                   within the next few decades. Despite this, data on
                   the course of hematological cancers among the oldest
                   patients are sparse with many intervention studies
                   focusing on younger age groups. The aim of this study
                   is to present Danish incidence and mortality rates
                   among older patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas
                   (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic
                   leukemia (CLL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
                   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nationwide population-based
                   study presenting the incidence, prevalence and
                   mortality rates of NHL, MM, and AML with a focus on
                   the elderly population in Denmark during the last few
                   decades. Data were drawn from the NORDCAN database.
                   RESULTS: Incidence rates of NHL, MM, CLL and AML were
                   10-50 times higher among the population aged 70 years
                   or more than among the younger population. An
                   increasing incidence with stable or decreased
                   mortality rates was seen mainly among elderly
                   patients with NHL during the last few decades,
                   leading to increased survival and a greater
                   prevalence of patients with NHL. Increased relative
                   survival and prevalence could also be seen among
                   elderly patients with MM and CLL, while the trends of
                   the incidence rates were inconclusive for these
                   diseases. Survival among patients with AML improved
                   most notably in those aged below 70 years leading to
                   an increased prevalence of AML patients predominantly
                   in this age group. CONCLUSION: Improvements in
                   diagnostics and treatment have led to increased
                   survival and therefore prevalence of elderly patients
                   with NHL, MM, CLL and AML during the past decades.},

                   between January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2017 and based

                   in some countries but remained stable in areas with
                   high case ascertainment and access to universal
                   medical care. The crude incidence is increasing
                   globally due to an ageing population. Survival rates
                   have improved and 5-year relative survival rates are
                   now around 50\% and over 60\% in patients 65--70
                   years or younger., Preliminary data suggest a 3-fold
                   increase in the prevalence of multiple myeloma., We

                   aging populations and (2) more patients living longer

                   In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720
                   cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United
                   States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through
                   2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991
                   because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection
                   for some cancers, and improved treatment options in

                   these gains are threatened by increasing incidence
                   for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates
                   increased during 2015--2019 by 0.6\%--1\% annually
                   for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and

                   kidney, and human papillomavirus-associated oral
                   cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also
                   increased by 1\%--2\% annually for cervical (ages

                   women younger than 50 years in the late-1990s but is
                   now first in men and second in women. Progress is

                   differentiating MGUS from MM and macroglobulinemia.
                   The plasma cell labeling index and the presence of
                   circulating plasma cells in the peripheral blood are
                   indicators of active disease; however, there are no
                   findings at the diagnosis of MGUS that reliably
                   distinguish patients who will remain stable from
                   those in whom a malignant condition will develop.
                   Thus, a physician must perform serial measurements of
                   the M-protein in the serum and periodic evaluation of
                   the pertinent clinical and laboratory features to
                   determine whether MM, macroglobulinemia, systemic
                   amyloidosis, or related disorders have developed.
                   Solitary plasmacytoma is characterized by the
                   presence of a tumor consisting of monoclonal plasma
                   cells identical to those in MM. In addition, skeletal
                   roentgenograms must show no lytic lesions, a bone
                   marrow aspirate must contain no evidence of MM, and
                   immunoelectrophoresis or immunofixation of the serum
                   and concentrated urine should show no M-protein.
                   Exceptions to the presence of an M-protein occur, but
                   therapy of the solitary lesion often results in
                   disappearance of the M-protein. Tumoricidal
                   irradiation (4000 to 5000 cGy) for approximately 4
                   weeks is the treatment of choice. Overt MM occurs in
                   approximately 50\% of patients with solitary
                   plasmacytoma. Progression occurs in most patients
                   within 3 years. The three patterns of failure are (1)
                   development of MM, (2) local recurrence, and (3)
                   development of new bone lesions in the absence of
                   MM.},

  abstract =      {Monoclonal gammopathy is a common condition,
                   particularly in the elderly. It can indicate
                   symptomatic multiple myeloma or another overt
                   malignant lymphoid disorder requiring immediate
                   chemotherapy. More frequently, it results from a
                   small and/or quiescent secreting B-cell clone, is
                   completely asymptomatic, and requires regular
                   monitoring only, defining a monoclonal gammopathy of
                   unknown significance (MGUS). Sometimes, although
                   quiescent and not requiring any treatment per se, the
                   clone is associated with potentially severe organ
                   damage due to the toxicity of the monoclonal
                   immunoglobulin or to other mechanisms. The latter
                   situation is increasingly observed but still poorly
                   recognized and frequently undertreated, although it
                   often requires rapid specific intervention to
                   preserve involved organ function. To improve early
                   recognition and management of these small B-cell
                   clone-related disorders, we propose to introduce the
                   concept of monoclonal gammopathy of clinical
                   significance (MGCS). This report identifies the
                   spectrum of MGCSs that are classified according to
                   mechanisms of tissue injury. It highlights the
                   diversity of these disorders for which diagnosis and
                   treatment are often challenging in clinical practice
                   and require a multidisciplinary approach. Principles
                   of management, including main diagnostic and
                   therapeutic procedures, are also described.
                   Importantly, efficient control of the underlying
                   B-cell clone usually results in organ improvement.
                   Currently, it relies mainly on chemotherapy and other
                   anti-B-cell/plasma cell agents, which should aim at
                   rapidly producing the best hematological response.},

                   (hypercalcaemia, renal failure, anaemia, and bone

                   who would otherwise be regarded as having smouldering

  abstract =      {Background Solitary plasmacytoma (SP) is a localized
                   neoplastic plasma cell disorder with an annual
                   incidence of less than 450 cases. Given the rarity of
                   this disorder, it is difficult to conduct large-scale
                   population studies. Consequently, very limited
                   information on the disorder is available, making it
                   difficult to estimate the incidence and survival
                   rates. Furthermore, limited information is available
                   on the efficacy of various treatment modalities in
                   relation to primary tumor sites. Methods The data for
                   this retrospective study were drawn from the
                   Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
                   database, which comprises 18 registries; patient
                   demographics, treatment modalities and survival rates
                   were obtained for those diagnosed with SP from 1998
                   to 2007. Various prognostic factors were analyzed via
                   Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test, with 5-year
                   relative survival rate defined as the primary outcome
                   of interest. Cox regression analysis was employed in
                   the multivariate analysis. Results The SEER search
                   from 1998 to 2007 yielded records for 1691 SP
                   patients. The median age at diagnosis was 63 years.
                   The patient cohort was 62.4\% male, 37.6\% female,
                   80\% Caucasian, 14.6\% African American and 5.4\%
                   other races. Additionally, 57.8\% had osseous
                   plasmacytoma, and 31.9\% had extraosseous
                   involvement. Unspecified plasmacytoma was noted in
                   10.2\% of patients. The most common treatment
                   modalities were radiotherapy (RT) (48.8\%), followed
                   by combination surgery with RT (21.2\%) and surgery
                   alone (11.6\%). Univariate analysis of prognostic
                   factors revealed that the survival outcomes were
                   better for younger male patients who received RT with
                   surgery (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Additionally, patients who
                   received neoadjuvant RT had increased survival rates
                   compared to those receiving adjuvant RT (86\% vs
                   73\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Furthermore, the analyses
                   revealed that 5-year survival rates for patients with
                   axial plasmacytoma were superior when RT was combined
                   with surgery (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). In the multivariate
                   analysis, age {$<$}60 years and treatment with either
                   RT or surgery showed superior survival rates.
                   Progression to multiple myeloma (MM) was noted in 551
                   patients. Age {$>$}60 years was associated with a
                   lower 5-year survival in patients who progressed to
                   MM compared to those who were diagnosed initially
                   with MM (15.1 vs 16.6\%). Finally, those who received
                   RT and progressed to MM still had a higher chance of
                   survival than those who were diagnosed with MM
                   initially and treated with RT/surgery (21.8\% vs
                   15.9\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Conclusions A review of the
                   pertinent literature indicates that we provided the
                   most comprehensive population-based analysis of SP to
                   date. Moreover, our study contributes to the
                   establishment of the optimal SP treatment modality,
                   as RT is the favored option in frontline settings.
                   Consensus is currently lacking regarding the benefits
                   of combined treatment including surgery. Thus, the
                   findings reported here elucidate the role of primary
                   treatment modalities while also demonstrating the
                   quantifiable benefits of combining RT with surgery in
                   relation to different primary tumor sites. While our
                   results are promising, they should be confirmed
                   through further large-scale randomized studies.

                   solitary extramedullary (soft tissue mass)
                   plasmacytoma, based on the site of the lesion.
                   Despite the high local control rate with
                   radiotherapy, approximately half of patients'
                   conditions progress to multiple myeloma (MM) within
                   3-5 years after diagnosis, with SBP having a worse
                   prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively
                   assessed the treatment and outcomes of patients with
                   SBP in a hospital in China from 2008 to 2021.
                   Twenty-four patients treated over 13 years with SBP
                   were enrolled in this retrospective study. RESULTS:
                   The most common sites for SBP were the axial skeleton
                   and femur. The M protein was detected in 11 patients
                   (46 \%), of which 8 (33 \%) had light chains, 2 (8
                   \%) had immunoglobulin G kappa and 1 (4 \%) had
                   immunoglobulin D kappa. Flow cytometry revealed that
                   5 patients (21 \%) had minimal bone marrow
                   involvement. The treatment included chemotherapy,
                   surgery, and radiotherapy in 18 (75 \%), 12 (50 \%),
                   and 9 (38 \%) patients, respectively, of whom 13 (54
                   \%) received combined treatment. Over a median
                   follow-up period of 67.2 months, 9 patients (38 \%)
                   developed MM in a median time of 101.5 months. The 5-
                   and 10-year progression-free survival rates were 67.3
                   \% and 37.4 \%, respectively. One patient died due to
                   pneumonia without progression and the other died due
                   to relapse. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the high
                   rate of progression of SBP to MM, indicating a need
                   for adjunct chemotherapy for the management of SBP.},

                   aimed to describe the myeloma-defining events (MDEs)
                   and clinical presentations leading to MM diagnosis
                   among SMM patients seen at our institution. We
                   included 406 patients diagnosed with SMM between
                   2013--2022, seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. The
                   2018 Mayo 20/2/20 criteria were used for risk
                   stratification. Median follow-up was 3.9 years. Among
                   high-risk patients who did not receive treatment in
                   the SMM phase (n\,=\,71), 51 progressed by last
                   follow-up; the MDEs included: bone lesions (37\%),
                   anemia (35\%), hypercalcemia (8\%), and renal failure
                   (6\%); 24\% met MM criteria based on marrow
                   plasmacytosis ({$\geq$}60\%) and/or free light chain
                   ratio ({$>$}100); 45\% had clinically significant
                   MDEs (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and/or bone
                   lesions). MM diagnosis was made based on surveillance
                   labs/imaging(45\%), testing obtained due to provider
                   suspicion for progression (14\%), bone pain (20\%),
                   and hospitalization/ED presentations due to MM
                   complications/symptoms (4\%). The presentation was
                   undocumented in 14\%. A high proportion (45\%) of
                   patients with high-risk SMM on active surveillance
                   develop end-organ damage at progression. About a
                   quarter of patients who progress to MM are not
                   diagnosed based on routine interval surveillance
                   testing.},

  abstract =      {Extramedullary involvement (or extramedullary
                   disease, EMD) represents an aggressive form of
                   multiple myeloma (MM), characterized by the ability
                   of a clone and/or subclone to thrive and grow
                   independent of the bone marrow microenvironment.
                   Several different definitions of EMD have been used
                   in the published literature. We advocate that true
                   EMD is restricted to soft-tissue plasmacytomas that
                   arise due to hematogenous spread and have no contact
                   with bony structures. Typical sites of EMD vary
                   according to the phase of MM. At diagnosis, EMD is
                   typically found in skin and soft tissues; at relapse,
                   typical sites involved include liver, kidneys, lymph
                   nodes, central nervous system (CNS), breast, pleura,
                   and pericardium. The reported incidence of EMD varies
                   considerably, and differences in diagnostic approach
                   between studies are likely to contribute to this
                   variability. In patients with newly diagnosed MM, the
                   reported incidence ranges from 0.5\% to 4.8\%, while
                   in relapsed/refractory MM the reported incidence is
                   3.4 to 14\%. Available data demonstrate that the
                   prognosis is poor, and considerably worse than for MM
                   without soft-tissue plasmacytomas. Among patients
                   with plasmacytomas, those with EMD have poorer
                   outcomes than those with paraskeletal involvement.
                   CNS involvement is rare, but prognosis is even more
                   dismal than for EMD in other locations, particularly
                   if there is leptomeningeal involvement. Available
                   data on treatment outcomes for EMD are derived almost
                   entirely from retrospective studies. Some agents and
                   combinations have shown a degree of efficacy but, as
                   would be expected, this is less than in MM patients
                   with no extramedullary involvement. The paucity of
                   prospective studies makes it difficult to justify
                   strong recommendations for any treatment approach.
                   Prospective data from patients with clearly defined
                   EMD are important for the optimal evaluation of
                   treatment outcomes.},

                   specialties like neurology, nephrology, orthopedics,

                   and high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem
                   cell transplant (ASCT). We analyzed the outcomes of
                   511 consecutive patients treated with novel therapies
                   at our institution between 2006 and 2014 to determine
                   the impact of relapse within 12 months of initiating
                   treatment. A total of 82 patients (16.0\%)
                   experienced early relapse, with median time to
                   relapse of 8.0 months (95\% confidence interval (CI);
                   6.3, 8.9). Median overall survival (OS) was
                   significantly worse for this group at 21.0 months

                   high-risk cytogenetics predicted early relapse.

                   hematological malignancy that arises when plasma
                   cells undergo malignant monoclonal proliferation.
                   This study aimed to assess the demographic
                   disparities and temporal trends in the mortality
                   rates of this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
                   employed the Center for Disease Control and
                   Prevention's Wide-ranging ONline Data for
                   Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER) database.
                   RESULTS: We found that for the overall U.S.
                   population, the age-adjusted mortality rate per
                   1,000,000 (AAMR) decreased from 1999 to 2020.
                   However, rates differed between demographic groups.
                   In addition, we sought to find a significant average
                   annual percent change (AAPC) in mortality rate from
                   1999 to 2020 for various demographic populations and
                   compared groups to find disparities in mortality rate
                   trend. In 2020, the AAMR due to MM was 38.0 and for
                   women 24.1. The AAPC in AAMR from 1999 to 2020 in men
                   was -1.0\% (95\%CI=-1.3 to -0.7) and in women was
                   -1.6\% (95\%CI=-1.6 to -2.3). A significant
                   difference in trend by sex was found, where women had
                   a higher rate of decline. In 2020, the AAMR for the
                   American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) population
                   was 15.0, the Asian American and Pacific Islander
                   (AAPI) had 14.8, the Black and African American
                   population had an AAMR of 55.6 and the White
                   population had an AAMR of 28.1. The AAPC for the
                   AI/AN population was -2.2\% (95\%CI=-3.5 to -0.9),
                   for the AAPI population it was -0.9\% (95\%CI=-1.5 to
                   -0.4), the Black and African American population had
                   -1.5\% (95\%CI=-2.2 to -0.8) and the AAPC for the
                   White population was -1.1\% (95\%CI=-1.6 to -0.6). A
                   significant difference in trend of decline was found
                   between the AAPI and Black and African American
                   populations and between the AI/AN and Black and
                   African American populations. When assessing the U.S.
                   by states, the mid-southeast U.S. had the greatest
                   density of the states with high AAMRs. CONCLUSION:
                   These findings suggest which populations are at
                   increased risk for mortality due to multiple myeloma
                   and where we should apply additional resources and
                   research.},

  abstract =      {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous disease with
                   survival ranging from months to decades. The goal of
                   'cure' remains elusive for most patients, but has
                   been shown to be possible, with durable remission and
                   a transition to a plateau phase (analogous to
                   monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain
                   significance/smoldering Myeloma (MGUS/SMM)). Two
                   representative cases set the stage to illustrate how
                   this might be possible and what still needs to be
                   determined to achieve functional disease control over
                   a prolonged period. Several developments have
                   emerged, such as improved diagnostics including the
                   definitions and use of SLiM-CRAB criteria and MRD
                   with whole genome- /single-cell-sequencing as well as
                   other correlates to better understand disease
                   biology. These advances enable earlier detection,
                   more accurate risk stratification and improved
                   personalized treatment strategies by facilitating
                   analysis of genetic alterations and clonal
                   heterogeneity. Whole genome sequencing may also
                   identify driver mutations and modes of resistance to
                   targets like immunotherapies (IOs) as well as other
                   targeted therapies. Today, induction with a CD38
                   antibody (CD38mAb), proteasome inhibitor,
                   immunomodulatory drug, and dexamethasone, potentially
                   followed by ASCT and lenalidomide maintenance, can be
                   considered standard of care for transplant-eligible
                   (TE) newly diagnosed (NDMM) patients. Whether
                   prolonged disease control and functional cure can be
                   achieved in non-transplant eligible (NTE) patients is
                   currently emerging as a distinct possibility: data
                   from phase III trials that incorporate a CD38mAb into
                   the treatment of NTE NDMM patients demonstrate
                   impressive MRD negativity rates that appear sustained
                   over several years. While the long-term durability of
                   CAR-Ts, bi-specific antibodies and other IOs are
                   evaluated, several clinical trials are now
                   investigating their role in frontline treatment for
                   TE and NTE patients. These will address whether
                   CAR-Ts will replace ASCT and whether such IOs will
                   represent a truly curative option. We conclude that
                   whilst cure remains elusive, the concept of
                   operational or functional cure provides a new
                   benchmark to strive for and is an emerging area of
                   active and potentially achievable clinical research
                   for MM.},

                   and emerging data from randomized trials to guide
                   therapy. Along the disease course, the choice of
                   specific therapy is affected by many variables
                   including age, performance status, comorbidities, and
                   eligibility for stem cell transplantation. In
                   addition, another key variable that affects treatment
                   strategy is risk stratification of patients into
                   standard and high-risk MM. High-risk MM is defined by
                   the presence of t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), gain 1q,
                   del(17p), or p53 mutation. In this paper, we provide
                   algorithms for the treatment of newly diagnosed and

                   disease, with the vast majority of patients relapsing
                   due to evolving genetic alterations within tumor cell
                   clones as well as the pressure of the

                   needed to further increase our understanding of MM

                   despite considerable improvements in treatment
                   strategies, as resistance to most currently available
                   agents is not uncommon. In this study, data on drug
                   resistance in MM were analyzed and led to the
                   following conclusions: resistance occurs via
                   intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, including
                   intraclonal heterogeneity, drug efflux pumps,
                   alterations of drug targets, the inhibition of
                   apoptosis, increased DNA repair and interactions with
                   the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, cell adhesion,
                   and the release of soluble factors. Since MM involves
                   the BM, interactions in the MM-BM microenvironment
                   were examined as well, with a focus on the cross-talk
                   between BM stromal cells (BMSCs), adipocytes,
                   osteoclasts, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and
                   immune cells. Given the complex mechanisms that drive
                   MM, next-generation treatment strategies that avoid
                   drug resistance must target both the neoplastic clone
                   and its non-malignant environment. Possible
                   approaches based on recent evidence include: (i)
                   proteasome and histone deacetylases inhibitors that
                   not only target MM but also act on BMSCs and
                   osteoclasts; (ii) novel peptide drug conjugates that
                   target both the MM malignant clone and angiogenesis
                   to unleash an effective anti-MM immune response.
                   Finally, the role of cancer stem cells in MM is
                   unknown but given their roles in the development of
                   solid and hematological malignancies, cancer relapse,
                   and drug resistance, their identification and
                   description are of paramount importance for MM

                   detected by magnetic resonance imaging have been
                   shown to be of prognostic significance in all stages
                   of monoclonal plasma cell disorders and have,
                   therefore, been incorporated into the definition of
                   the disease. The aim of this retrospective analysis
                   was to develop a rapidly evaluable prognostic scoring
                   system, incorporating the most significant
                   information acquired from magnetic resonance imaging.
                   Therefore, the impact of bone marrow infiltration
                   patterns on progression-free and overall survival in
                   161 transplant-eligible myeloma patients was
                   evaluated. Compared to salt and pepper/minimal
                   diffuse infiltration, moderate/severe diffuse
                   infiltration had a negative prognostic impact on both
                   progression-free survival (P{$<$}0.001) and overall
                   survival (P=0.003). More than 25 focal lesions on
                   whole-body magnetic resonance imaging or more than
                   seven on axial magnetic resonance imaging were
                   associated with an adverse prognosis
                   (progression-free survival: P=0.001/0.003 and overall
                   survival: P=0.04/0.02). A magnetic resonance
                   imaging-based prognostic scoring system, combining
                   grouped diffuse and focal infiltration patterns, was
                   formulated and is applicable to whole-body as well as
                   axial magnetic resonance imaging. The score
                   identified high-risk patients with median
                   progression-free and overall survival of 23.4 and
                   55.9 months, respectively (whole-body-based).
                   Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the magnetic
                   resonance imaging-based prognostic score stage III
                   (high-risk) and adverse cytogenetics are independent
                   prognostic factors for both progression-free and
                   overall survival (whole-body-based, progression-free
                   survival: hazard ratio=3.65, P{$<$}0.001; overall
                   survival: hazard ratio=5.19, P=0.005). In conclusion,
                   we suggest a magnetic resonance imaging-based
                   prognostic scoring system which is a robust, easy to
                   assess and interpret parameter summarizing
                   significant magnetic resonance imaging findings in
                   transplant-eligible patients with multiple myeloma.},

                   malignant monoclonal disease of plasma cells. Aside
                   from classical chemotherapy and glucocorticoids,
                   proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents and
                   monoclonal antibodies are used in the current
                   treatment scheme of MM. The tumor microenvironment
                   (TME) plays a fundamental role in the development and
                   progression of numerous solid and non-solid cancer
                   entities. In MM, the survival and expansion of
                   malignant plasma cell clones heavily depends on
                   various direct and indirect signaling pathways
                   provided by the surrounding bone marrow (BM) niche.
                   In a number of MM patients, single plasma cell clones
                   lose their BM dependency and are capable to engraft
                   at distant body sites or organs. The resulting
                   condition is defined as an extramedullary myeloma
                   (EMM). EMMs are highly aggressive disease stages
                   linked to a dismal prognosis. Emerging literature
                   demonstrates that the dynamic interactions between
                   the TME and malignant plasma cells affect myeloma
                   dissemination. In this review, we aim to summarize
                   how the cellular and non-cellular BM compartments can
                   promote plasma cells to exit their BM niche and
                   metastasize to distant intra-or extramedullary
                   locations. In addition, we list selected therapy
                   concepts that directly target the TME with the
                   potential to prevent myeloma spread.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

                   classified into three types: the first type occurs
                   during embryonic development, the second type is
                   associated with adult tissue regeneration, and the
                   third type occurs in cancer progression. EMT
                   occurring during embryonic development in
                   gastrulation, renal development, and the origin and
                   fate of the neural crest is a highly regulated
                   process, while EMT occurring during tumor progression
                   is highly deregulated. EMT allows the solid tumors to
                   become more malignant, increasing their invasiveness
                   and metastatic activity. Secondary tumors frequently
                   maintain the typical histologic characteristics of
                   the primary tumor. These histologic features
                   connecting the secondary metastatic tumors to the
                   primary is due to a process called
                   mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). MET has been
                   demonstrated in different mesenchymal tumors and is
                   the expression of the reversibility of EMT. EMT
                   modulation could constitute an approach to avoid
                   metastasis. Some of the targeted small molecules
                   utilized as antiproliferative agents have revealed to
                   inhibit EMT initiation or maintenance because EMT is
                   regulated through signaling pathways for which these
                   molecules have been designed.},

                   characterized by the presence of multiple myelomatous
                   ``omas'' throughout the skeleton, indicating that
                   there is continuous trafficking of tumor cells to

                   cell metastasis is described as a multistep process,
                   the invasion-metastasis cascade. This involves cell
                   invasion, intravasation into nearby blood vessels,
                   passage into the circulation, followed by homing into
                   predetermined distant tissues, the formation of new
                   foci of micrometastases, and finally the growth of
                   micrometastasis into macroscopic tumors. This review

                   dissemination is a critical feature of disease
                   progression in the blood cancer multiple myeloma. At
                   diagnosis, myeloma patients have cancer that has
                   spread throughout the bone marrow, with patients with
                   more disseminatory myeloma having worse outcomes for
                   their disease. In this review, we discuss the current
                   understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the
                   dissemination process in multiple myeloma.
                   Furthermore, we discuss the potential for the use of
                   therapies that target the dissemination process as a
                   novel means of improving outcomes for multiple
                   myeloma patients. Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is a
                   plasma cell (PC) malignancy characterised by the
                   presence of MM PCs at multiple sites throughout the
                   bone marrow. Increased numbers of peripheral blood MM
                   PCs are associated with rapid disease progression,
                   shorter time to relapse and are a feature of advanced
                   disease. In this review, the current understanding of
                   the process of MM PC dissemination and the extrinsic
                   and intrinsic factors potentially driving it are
                   addressed through analysis of patient-derived MM PCs
                   and MM cell lines as well as mouse models of homing
                   and dissemination. In addition, we discuss how
                   patient cytogenetic subgroups that present with
                   highly disseminated disease, such as t(4;14),
                   t(14;16) and t(14;20), suggest that intrinsic
                   properties of MM PC influence their ability to
                   disseminate. Finally, we discuss the possibility of
                   using therapeutic targeting of tumour dissemination
                   to slow disease progression and prevent overt
                   relapse.},

  abstract =      {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant B-cell disorder
                   characterized by a monoclonal expansion of plasma
                   cells (PC) in the bone marrow (BM). During the main
                   course of disease evolution, MM cells depend on the
                   BM microenvironment for their growth and survival.
                   Reciprocal interactions between MM cells and the BM
                   mediate not only MM cell growth, but also protect
                   them against apoptosis and cause bone disease and
                   angiogenesis. A striking feature of MM represents the
                   predominant localization and retention of MM cells in
                   the BM. Although BM PC indeed represent the main
                   neoplastic cell type, small numbers of MM cells can
                   also be detected in the peripheral blood circulation.
                   It can be assumed that these circulating cells
                   represent the tumour-spreading component of the
                   disease. This implicates that MM cells have the
                   capacity to (re)circulate, to extravasate and to
                   migrate to the BM (homing). In analogy to the
                   migration and homing of normal leucocytes, the BM
                   homing of MM cells is mediated by a multistep process
                   of extravasation with adhesion to the endothelium,
                   invasion of the subendothelial basement membrane,
                   followed by further migration within the stroma,
                   mediated by chemotactic factors. At the end stage of
                   disease, MM cells are thought to develop autocrine
                   growth supporting loops that enable them to survive
                   and proliferate in the absence of the BM
                   microenvironment and to become stroma-independent. In
                   this stage, the number of circulating cells increases
                   and growth at extramedullary sites can occur,
                   associated with alteration in adhesion molecule and
                   chemokine receptor expression. This review summarizes
                   the recent progress in the study of the extravasation
                   and homing mechanisms of MM cells.},

                   suggesting the involvement of specific adhesive

                   experimental mouse model of myeloma.
                   Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
                   demonstrated expression of CD44v6, CD44v7, and

                   and 5T33MM cells to BM endothelial cells. Coinjection
                   of anti-CD44v10 antibodies with the myeloma cells

                   N-cadherin (cadherin 2, type 1, N-cadherin
                   (neuronal); CDH2) is associated with poor prognosis
                   in newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients. In
                   this study, we investigated whether targeting of
                   N-cadherin represents a potential treatment for the
                   50\% of MM patients with elevated N-cadherin.
                   Initially, we stably knocked-down N-cadherin in the
                   mouse MM plasma cell (PC) line 5TGM1 to assess the
                   functional role of N-cadherin in MM pathogenesis.
                   When compared with 5TGM1-scramble-shRNA cells,
                   5TGM1-Cdh2-shRNA cells had significantly reduced
                   adhesion to bone marrow endothelial cells. However,
                   N-cadherin knock-down did not affect 5TGM1 cell
                   proliferation or adhesion to bone marrow stromal
                   cells. In the C57BL/KaLwRij murine MM model, mice
                   intravenously inoculated with 5TGM1-Cdh2-shRNA cells
                   showed significantly decreased tumour burden after 4
                   weeks, compared with animals bearing
                   5TGM1-scramble-shRNA cells. Finally, the N-cadherin
                   antagonist ADH-1 had no effect on tumour burden in
                   the established disease setting, whereas up-front
                   ADH-1 treatment resulted in significantly reduced
                   tumour burden after 4 weeks. Our findings demonstrate
                   that N-cadherin may play a key role in the
                   extravasation of circulating MM PCs promoting bone
                   marrow homing. Moreover, these studies suggest that
                   N-cadherin may represent a viable therapeutic target
                   to prevent the dissemination of MM PCs and delay MM
                   disease progression.},

                   malignancy of terminally differentiated
                   immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells. As a common
                   presentation of the disease, the malignant plasma
                   cells accumulate and proliferate in the bone marrow,
                   where they disrupt normal hematopoiesis and bone
                   physiology. Multiple myeloma cells and the bone
                   marrow microenvironment are linked by a composite
                   network of interactions mediated by soluble factors
                   and adhesion molecules. Integrins and
                   syndecan-1/CD138 are the principal multiple myeloma
                   receptor systems of extracellular matrix components,
                   as well as of surface molecules of stromal cells.
                   CD44 and RHAMM are the major hyaluronan receptors of
                   multiple myeloma cells. The SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is a key
                   factor in the homing of multiple myeloma cells to the
                   bone marrow. The levels of expression and activity of
                   these adhesion molecules are controlled by
                   cytoplasmic operating mechanisms, as well as by
                   extracellular factors including enzymes, growth
                   factors and microenvironmental conditions. Several
                   signaling responses are activated by adhesive
                   interactions of multiple myeloma cells, and their
                   outcomes affect the survival, proliferation and
                   migration of these cells, and in many cases generate
                   a drug-resistant phenotype. Hence, the adhesion
                   systems of multiple myeloma cells are attractive
                   potential therapeutic targets. Several approaches are
                   being developed to disrupt the activities of adhesion
                   molecules in multiple myeloma cells, including small
                   antagonist molecules, direct targeting by
                   immunoconjugates, stimulation of immune responses
                   against these molecules, and signal transduction
                   inhibitors. These potential novel therapeutics may be
                   incorporated into current treatment schemes, or
                   directed against minimal residual malignant cells
                   during remission.},

                   integrins on natural killer (NK) cells, for example,
                   bind to the ECM fibronectin and transduce signals
                   intracellularly by induction of tyrosine
                   phosphorylation of paxillin.44 The interaction of
                   adhesion molecules with ligands on target cells may
                   alter their cell surface phenotype and functional
                   repertoire, including migration, cytokine secretion,
                   and growth.35, 67 Exogenous stimuli can similarly
                   alter adhesion molecule expression and cellular
                   function. For example, both hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl
                   acetate and ezrin upregulate adhesion molecules on NK
                   cells, and ezrin also enhances interleukin
                   (IL)-2--mediated NK cell killing.18, 28 Finally, the
                   functional significance of adhesion molecules is
                   confirmed by clinical conditions that arise when they
                   are lacking. For example, the ``leukocyte adhesion
                   deficiencies'' are characterized by recurrent severe
                   infections in children and are either type 1,
                   resulting from lack of lymphocyte
                   function--associated antigen (LFA)-1 and Mac-1, or
                   type 2, with deficiency of Sialyl-Lewis X ligand for
                   E selectin.13 In the setting of malignancies,
                   adhesion molecules play a role in homotypic adhesion
                   of tumor cells, as well as in tumor cell homing,
                   local invasion, and distant metastases. In addition,
                   the pattern of expression of adhesion molecules on
                   tumor cells has been correlated with disease course
                   and prognosis. For example, intercellular adhesion
                   molecule (ICAM)-1 is expressed on hematologic
                   malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia
                   (ALL) and Hodgkin"s disease (HD) cells, as well as on
                   solid tumors, such as sarcoma. Increased expression
                   of ICAM-1 correlates with stage of disease in HD as
                   well as Ewing"s sarcoma, and with relapse in HD.42
                   Within multiple myeloma (MM), LFA-1 expression is
                   correlated with tumor cell growth.1 Moreover, in MM
                   as well as in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
                   (CLL), tumor cells bearing adhesion molecules are
                   correlated with advanced-stage disease and poor
                   prognosis.11, 24, 52 In addition, different epitopes
                   on adhesion molecules often mediate different
                   biologic functions,32, 43 and variations in their
                   genetic and/or molecular structure may correlate with
                   phenotypic variations of the tumor cell and disease
                   course.17, 19, 47 In MM, for example, different CD44
                   splice variants define prognostic subgroups of
                   patients.56 Finally, levels of circulating adhesion
                   molecules in some cases have clinical importance. For
                   example, serum neural cell adhesion molecule (eNCAM,
                   CD56) expression is associated with malignant, rather
                   than benign, paraproteinemia.37},

                   metastasize. The molecular mechanisms underlying the

                   largely unknown. Herein, we report that decorin

                   that DCN inhibits tumorigenesis and metastasis in IBC

                   (BM) stroma consisting of stromal cells, secreted
                   cytokines and the extracellular matrix (ECM).
                   Decorin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan in the
                   ECM, is a signaling ligand and native anti-tumor
                   agent. However, the role of decorin in patients with
                   myeloma is not clear. We evaluated the correlation
                   between the decorin levels measured by enzyme-linked
                   immunosorbent assay in BM plasma from 121 patients
                   with newly diagnosed myeloma based on their clinical
                   features and treatment response. The median decorin
                   levels in the patients and the normal control group
                   were 12.31 ng/mL [standard deviation (SD), 7.50
                   ng/mL; range, 2.45 to 44.46 ng/mL] and 10.31 ng/mL
                   (SD, 2.42 ng/mL; range, 4.85-15.14 ng/mL),
                   respectively (P {$<$} 0.001). Using 15.15 ng/mL as a
                   cut-off, 46 patients (38\%) exhibited higher decorin
                   levels (H-DCN), whereas the other patients exhibited
                   normal to lower decorin levels (NL-DCN). Except for
                   the median age, which was significantly younger in
                   the H-DCN than in the NL-DCN group (60.6 {\textpm}

                   0.034), there were no differences between the two
                   groups. However, in 79 patients who had received
                   novel agent-based induction, the overall response
                   rate was significantly better in the H-DCN than in
                   the NL-DCN (97 vs. 63\%, respectively; P {$<$}

                   which were not observed in those who had received
                   chemotherapeutic agents alone. Progression-free
                   survival (PFS) was significantly longer in H-DCN than
                   NL-DCN (not reached vs. 19.5 mo, respectively; P =
                   0.0003). Multivariate analyses indicated that H-DCN,
                   as a significantly independent factor, was associated
                   with better treatment response (odds ratio, 20.014;

                   which is characterized by a predominant localization
                   of the malignant cell clone within the bone marrow.
                   With the exception of the terminal stage of the
                   disease the myeloma tumor cells do not circulate in
                   the peripheral blood. The bone marrow
                   microenvironment is believed to play an important
                   role in homing, proliferation and terminal
                   differentiation of myeloma cells. Here we have
                   studied the expression of several extracellular
                   matrix (ECM) molecules in the bone marrow of multiple
                   myeloma patients and analyzed their adhesive
                   capacities with four different human myeloma-derived
                   cell lines. All ECM molecules analyzed (tenascin,
                   laminin, fibronectin, collagen types I, III, V and
                   VI) could be detected in bone marrow cryostat
                   sections of multiple myeloma patients. Adhesion
                   assays showed that only laminin, the microfibrillar
                   collagen type VI and fibronectin were strong adhesive
                   components for the myeloma cell lines U266, IM-9,
                   OPM-2 and NCI-H929. Tenascin and collagen type I were
                   only weak adhesive substrates for these myeloma
                   cells. Adhesion to laminin and fibronectin was beta
                   1-integrin-mediated since addition of anti-beta
                   1-integrin antibodies could inhibit the binding of
                   the four different cell types to both matrix
                   molecules. In contrast, integrins do not seem to be
                   involved in binding of the myeloma cells to collagen
                   type VI. Instead, inhibition of binding by heparin
                   suggested that membrane-bound heparan sulfate
                   proteoglycans are responsible ligands for binding to
                   collagen type VI. Adhesion assays with several B-cell
                   lines resembling earlier differentiation stages
                   revealed only weak interactions with tenascin and no
                   interactions with collagen type VI, laminin or
                   fibronectin. In summary, the interactions of human
                   myeloma cells with the extracellular matrix may
                   explain the specific retention of the plasma cells
                   within the bone marrow.},

                   underscored the importance of BLyS and APRIL as
                   factors that can support the survival of B lineage
                   lymphocytes. We show that BLyS can sustain PC
                   survival in vitro, and this survival can be further
                   enhanced by interleukin 6. Selective up-regulation of
                   Mcl-1 in PCs by BLyS suggests that this
                   {$\alpha$}-apoptotic gene product may play an

                   APRIL) in serum-free cultures of human myeloma cell

                   contrary, all 5 CD45+ HMCLs could not survive and
                   required addition of either IL-6 (5/5), IGF-1 (4/5),

                   IGF-1R inhibitor only, whereas IL-6, HGF or HB-EGF
                   activity was inhibited by both IGF-1R- and

                   expressions of IGF-1R and IL-6R in myeloma cells

                   t(4;14) translocation, but IGF-1R expression in MMC,
                   without t(4;14) can also have a poor prognosis. Thus,
                   IGF-1 targeted therapy -- eventually in combination

                   malignancy caused by aberrant plasma cell
                   proliferation in the bone marrow (BM) and constitutes
                   the second most common hematological disease after
                   non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The disease progression is
                   drastically regulated by the immunosuppressive tumor
                   microenvironment (TME) generated by soluble factors
                   and different cells that naturally reside in the BM.
                   This microenvironment does not remain unchanged and
                   alterations favor cancer dissemination. Despite
                   therapeutic advances over the past 15 years, MM
                   remains incurable and therefore understanding the
                   elements that control the TME in MM would allow
                   better-targeted therapies to cure this disease. In
                   this review, we discuss the main events and changes
                   that occur in the BM milieu during MM development.
                   Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic
                   cancer characterized by clonal proliferation of
                   plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). The
                   progression, from the early stages of the disease as
                   monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
                   (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) to MM
                   and occasionally extramedullary disease, is
                   drastically affected by the tumor microenvironment
                   (TME). Soluble factors and direct cell--cell
                   interactions regulate MM plasma cell trafficking and
                   homing to the BM niche. Mesenchymal stromal cells,
                   osteoclasts, osteoblasts, myeloid and lymphoid cells
                   present in the BM create a unique milieu that favors
                   MM plasma cell immune evasion and promotes disease
                   progression. Moreover, TME is implicated in malignant
                   cell protection against anti-tumor therapy. This
                   review describes the main cellular and non-cellular
                   components located in the BM, which condition the
                   immunosuppressive environment and lead the MM

                   through its ligand CXCL12 to regulate diverse
                   physiological processes. CXCR4/CXCL12 axis plays a

                   dissemination and drug resistance in multiple myeloma
                   (MM). Apart from its role in homing, CXCR4 also
                   affects MM cell mobilization and egression out of the
                   bone marrow (BM) which is correlated with distant
                   organ metastasis. Aberrant CXCR4 expression pattern
                   is associated with osteoclastogenesis and tumor
                   growth in MM through its cross talk with various
                   important cell signalling pathways. A deeper insight
                   into understanding of CXCR4 mediated signalling
                   pathways and its role in MM is essential to identify
                   potential therapeutic interventions. The current
                   therapeutic focus is on disrupting the interaction of
                   MM cells with its protective tumor microenvironment
                   where CXCR4 axis plays an essential role. There are

                   target CXCR4 axis more efficiently and to identify
                   novel combination therapies with existing strategies.

                   chemokines, MIP-1{$\alpha$}, MCP-1, IL-8, and SDF-1,
                   and their receptors play important roles in homing of
                   MM cells, tumor growth, and bone destruction in
                   myeloma. They are attractive therapeutic targets for
                   treating myeloma patients. Conclusion Addition of
                   chemokine antagonists to current treatment regimens
                   for myeloma should result in better therapeutic
                   responses because of the loss of both the protective
                   effect of the marrow microenvironment on the MM cells
                   and the induction of osteoclast activity.},

                   effect of the chemokine SDF-1 (CXCL12) and its
                   receptor CXCR4 on the migration and homing of MM
                   cells. We demonstrated that CXCR4 is differentially
                   expressed at high levels in the peripheral blood and
                   is down-regulated in the bone marrow in response to
                   high levels of SDF-1. SDF-1 induced motility,
                   internalization, and cytoskeletal rearrangement in MM
                   cells evidenced by confocal microscopy. The specific
                   CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 and the anti-CXCR4 antibody
                   MAB171 inhibited the migration of MM cells in vitro.
                   CXCR4 knockdown experiments demonstrated that
                   SDF-1-dependent migration was regulated by the P13K
                   and ERK/ MAPK pathways but not by p38 MAPK. In
                   addition, we demonstrated that AMD3100 inhibited the
                   homing of MM cells to the bone marrow niches using in
                   vivo flow cytometry, in vivo confocal microscopy, and
                   whole body bioluminescence imaging. This study,
                   therefore, demonstrates that SDF-1/CXCR4 is a
                   critical regulator of MM homing and that it provides
                   the framework for inhibitors of this pathway to be

                   lead to EMD have not been well defined. We developed
                   bone marrow (BM)- and EMD-prone MM syngeneic cell
                   lines; identified that epithelial-to-mesenchymal

                   significantly enriched in both clones compared to
                   parental cells, together with higher levels of CXCR4

                   axis-targeted therapies in multiple myeloma. Abstract
                   The C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is a
                   pleiotropic chemokine receptor that is expressed in
                   not only normal hematopoietic cells but also multiple
                   myeloma cells. Its ligand, stromal cell-derived
                   factor 1{$\alpha$} (SDF-1{$\alpha$}) is produced in
                   the bone marrow microenvironment. The
                   SDF-1{$\alpha$}/CXCR4 axis plays a pivotal role in
                   the major physiological processes associated with
                   tumor proliferation, survival, invasion,
                   dissemination, and drug resistance in myeloma cells.
                   This review summarizes the pleiotropic role of the
                   SDF-1{$\alpha$}/CXCR4 axis in multiple myeloma and

                   the presence of peripheral blood (PB) clonal plasma
                   cells (PCs) are a powerful prognostic marker in
                   multiple myeloma (MM). However, the biological
                   features of CTCs and their pathophysiological role in

                   of CTCs vs paired bone marrow (BM) clonal PCs from MM
                   patients. Our results show that CTCs typically
                   represent a unique subpopulation of all BM clonal

                   analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted
                   CTCs also unraveled different cytogenetic profiles vs

                   quiescent and associated with higher clonogenic
                   potential when cocultured with BM stromal cells. Most
                   interestingly, CTCs showed a circadian distribution
                   which fluctuates in a similar pattern to that of
                   CD34(+) cells, and opposite to stromal cell-derived

                   expression of CXC chemokine receptor 4 on clonal PCs,

                   is known regarding mechanisms that control metastasis
                   of this cancer. Heparanase-1 (heparanase), an enzyme
                   that cleaves heparan sulfate chains, is expressed at
                   high levels in some patients with myeloma and
                   promotes metastasis of some tumor types (eg, breast,
                   lymphoma). Using a severe combined immunodeficient
                   (SCID) mouse model, we demonstrate that enhanced
                   expression of heparanase by myeloma cells
                   dramatically up-regulates their spontaneous
                   metastasis to bone. This occurs from primary tumors
                   growing subcutaneously and also from primary tumors
                   established in bone. Interestingly, tumors formed by
                   subcutaneous injection of cells metastasize not only
                   to bone, but also to other sites including spleen,
                   liver, and lung. In contrast, tumors formed by
                   injection of cells directly into bone exhibit a
                   restricted pattern of metastasis that includes

                   is highly expressed on the myeloma cell surface, but
                   its functional role in vivo is unclear, as well as
                   the ontogeny of CD138-high and CD138-negative (neg)
                   myeloma cells. In this study we used an in vivo
                   murine Vk*MYC myeloma model where CD138 is
                   heterogeneously expressed depending on tumor size. We
                   find that in comparison to CD138-neg myeloma cells,
                   the CD138-high subset of myeloma cells is highly
                   proliferative, less apoptotic, and enhanced IL-6R
                   signaling, which is known to promote survival. In
                   addition CD138-high myeloma engrafts better than its
                   CD138-neg counterpart. In contrast, CD138-neg cells
                   are more motile both in vitro and in vivo, and more
                   readily disseminate and spread to other bones in vivo
                   than CD138-high subset. Neutralizing CD138 rapidly
                   triggers migration of myeloma cells in vivo and leads
                   to intravasation, which results in increased
                   dissemination to other bones. Both murine and human
                   myeloma cells can rapidly recycle CD138 surface
                   expression through endocytic trafficking, in response
                   to serum levels. Blocking CD138 enhances myeloma
                   sensitivity to bortezomib chemotherapy and
                   significantly reduces tumor size compared to
                   bortezomib treatment alone. Thus, our data show that
                   CD138 surface expression dynamically regulates a
                   switch between growth vs. dissemination for myeloma,

                   Metastasis of malignant cells from their primary
                   tumor site to~distant organs is the most common
                   reason for cancer-related deaths. Junctional
                   adhesion~molecule-C (JAM-C), a member of the
                   immunoglobulin-like JAM family, can homodimerize and
                   aid cancer cell migration and metastasis. Here we
                   show that this molecule is dynamically expressed on
                   multiple myeloma (MM) cells in the bone marrow and
                   co-localizes with blood vessels within the bone
                   marrow of patients and mice. In addition,
                   upregulation of JAM-C inversely correlates with the
                   downregulation of the canonical plasma cell marker
                   CD138 (syndecan-1), whose surface expression has
                   recently been found to dynamically regulate a switch
                   between MM growth in situ and MM dissemination.
                   Moreover, targeting JAM-C in a syngeneic in~vivo MM
                   model ameliorates MM progression and improves
                   outcome. Overall, our data demonstrate that JAM-C
                   might serve not only as an additional novel
                   diagnostic biomarker but also as a therapeutic target

                   patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
                   significance. In patients with MM, autocrine IL-6
                   production paralleled the clinical disease stage. The
                   largest proportion of syndecan-1(+)/IL-6(+) cells was
                   detected in patients with resistant relapse or
                   primary refractory disease, suggesting that tumor
                   progression involves expansion of myeloma cells
                   producing IL-6. The authors assessed autocrine IL-6
                   production and in vitro proliferation and apoptosis
                   of myeloma cells in 6 myeloma cell clones (MCCs) and
                   in 2 myeloma cell lines, namely IM-9 and U-266-1970,
                   which showed different sensitivities to the addition
                   of exogenous IL-6. Autocrine IL-6 production was
                   observed in IL-6-independent MCC-2, MCC-3, and MCC-5
                   cloned from patients with aggressive disease and in
                   the IM-9 cell line. In contrast, IL-6-dependent
                   MCC-1, MCC-4, and MCC-6 were syndecan-1(+) and
                   IL-6(-). Blocking experiments with anti-IL-6
                   monoclonal antibody from clone AH65, which binds
                   IL-6-IL-6Ralpha complexes, prevented cell
                   proliferation of IL-6(+) MCCs. Flow cytometry
                   evaluations after propidium iodide staining revealed
                   different susceptibilities of MCCs to cell death.
                   IL-6-producing MCCs showed minimal spontaneous and
                   dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, whereas a regular
                   amplitude of apoptosis occurred in the IL-6(-) MCCs.
                   These data provide evidence that autocrine IL-6
                   reflects a highly malignant phenotype of myeloma
                   cells. In fact, autocrine IL-6 production and
                   deregulated apoptosis may induce expansion of
                   selective IL-6(+) myeloma cells resistant to
                   spontaneous and drug-induced cell death.},

                   patients with MM secreted significantly more IL-6
                   than those from healthy donors (n = 3, P {$<$} .001);
                   moreover, after stimulation using CD40L, IL-6
                   secretion was fourfold greater (n = 3, P {$<$} .001)
                   from MM BMMCs and BMSCs than from normal BMMCs and
                   BMSCs. Myeloma (CD38+CD45RA-) cells and non-MM
                   (CD38+CD45RA+, CD38-CD45RA+, and CD38-CD45RA-) BMMCs
                   were separated by dual fluorescence cell sorting. The
                   latter secreted fourfold more IL-6 than the former (n
                   = 2, P {$<$} .001). Increased IL-6 secretion (up to
                   28-fold) and proliferation (Stimulation index 10) by
                   CD38+CD45RA-MM cells was triggered by culture with
                   NIH3T3 CD40LT cells. Finally, anti-CD40MoAb partially
                   (30\%) blocked tumor cell to BMSC adhesion-induced
                   IL-6 secretion. These studies support the view that
                   CD40L may trigger IL-6 secretion by both MM cells and
                   BMSCs and that IL-6-mediated autocrine and paracrine
                   growth mechanisms may be possible in MM.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is an incurable
                   malignancy of bone marrow plasma cells. Progression
                   of multiple myeloma is accompanied by an increase in
                   bone marrow angiogenesis. Studies from our laboratory
                   suggest a role for the CXCL12 chemokine in this
                   process, with circulating levels of CXCL12
                   correlating with bone marrow angiogenesis in patients
                   with multiple myeloma. While the mechanisms
                   responsible for aberrant plasma cell expression of
                   CXCL12 remain to be determined, studies in other
                   systems suggest a role for hypoxia and
                   hypoxia-inducible transcription factors. DESIGN AND
                   METHODS: The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor
                   protein was examined in patients' bone marrow biopsy
                   specimens using immunohistochemistry. The hypoxic
                   regulation of CXCL12 was examined in multiple myeloma
                   plasma cell lines using polymerase chain reaction and
                   western blotting. The role of hypoxia-inducible
                   factors-1 and -2 in the regulation of CXCL12
                   expression was examined using over-expression and
                   short hairpin RNA knockdown constructs,
                   electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin
                   immunoprecipitation. The contribution of CXCL12 to
                   hypoxia-induced angiogenesis was examined in vivo
                   using a subcutaneous murine model of
                   neovascularization. RESULTS: Strong hypoxia-inducible
                   factor-2 protein expression was detected in CD138(+)
                   multiple myeloma plasma cells in patients' biopsy
                   specimens. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia strongly
                   up-regulated CXCL12 expression in multiple myeloma
                   plasma cells and hypoxia-inducible factor-2 was found
                   to play a key role in this response. Promoter
                   analyses revealed increased hypoxia-inducible
                   factor-2 binding to the CXCL12 promoter under hypoxic
                   conditions. Over-expression of hypoxia-inducible
                   factor in multiple myeloma plasma cells strongly
                   induced in vivo angiogenesis, and administration of a
                   CXCL12 antagonist decreased hypoxia-inducible
                   factor-induced angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS:
                   Hypoxia-inducible factor-2 is a newly identified
                   regulator of CXCL12 expression in multiple myeloma
                   plasma cells and a major contributor to multiple
                   myeloma plasma cell-induced angiogenesis. Targeting
                   the hypoxic niche, and more specifically
                   hypoxia-inducible factor-2, may represent a viable
                   strategy to inhibit angiogenesis in multiple myeloma
                   and progression of this disease.},

  abstract =      {The reason why a few myeloma cells egress from the
                   bone marrow (BM) into peripheral blood (PB) remains
                   unknown. Here, we investigated molecular hallmarks of
                   circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to identify the events
                   leading to myeloma trafficking into the bloodstream.
                   After using next-generation~flow to isolate matched
                   CTCs and BM tumor cells from 32 patients, we found
                   high correlation in gene expression at single-cell
                   and bulk levels (r\,{$\geq$}\,0.94, P\,=\,10-16),
                   with only 55 genes differentially expressed between
                   CTCs and BM tumor cells. CTCs overexpressed genes
                   involved in inflammation, hypoxia, or
                   epithelial-mesenchymal~transition, whereas genes
                   related with proliferation were downregulated in
                   CTCs. The cancer stem cell marker CD44 was
                   overexpressed in CTCs, and its knockdown
                   significantly reduced migration of MM cells towards
                   SDF1-{$\alpha$} and their adhesion to fibronectin.
                   Approximately half (29/55) of genes differentially
                   expressed in CTCs were prognostic in patients with
                   newly-diagnosed myeloma (n\,=\,553; CoMMpass). In a
                   multivariate analysis including the R-ISS,
                   overexpression of CENPF and LGALS1 was significantly
                   associated with inferior survival. Altogether, these
                   results help understanding the presence of CTCs in PB
                   and suggest that hypoxic BM niches together with a
                   pro-inflammatory microenvironment induce an arrest in
                   proliferation, forcing tumor cells to circulate in PB
                   and seek other BM niches to continue growing.},

                   regulation of cell survival, proliferation,
                   differentiation and metastasis. In multiple myeloma
                   (MM), interactions between MM cells and the bone
                   marrow (BM) microenvironment, including the BM ECM,
                   are critical to the pathogenesis of the disease and
                   the development of drug resistance. Nevertheless,
                   composition of the ECM in MM and its role in
                   supporting MM pathogenesis has not been reported. We
                   have applied a novel proteomic-based strategy and
                   defined the BM ECM composition in patients with
                   monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance

                   that the tumor ECM is remodeled at the mRNA and
                   protein levels in MGUS and MM to allow development of
                   a permissive microenvironment. We further demonstrate
                   that two ECM-affiliated proteins, ANXA2 and LGALS1,
                   are more abundant in MM and high expression is
                   associated with a decreased overall survival. This

                   Bone metastases are currently incurable and therefore
                   better treatments need to be developed. Metastasis is
                   an inefficient, multi-step process. Specific aspects
                   of both breast cancer cells and the bone
                   microenvironment contribute to the development of
                   bone metastases. Breast cancers express chemokine
                   receptors, integrins, cadherins, and bone-resorbing
                   and bone-forming factors that contribute to the
                   successful and preferential spread of tumor to bone.
                   Bone is rich in growth factors and cell types that
                   make it a hospitable environment for breast cancer
                   growth. Once breast cancer cells enter the bone, a
                   highly complex vicious cycle develops, in which
                   breast cancer cells secrete factors that act on bone
                   cells and other cells within the bone (stem cells, T

                   (PCa) metastasis; however, little is known about the
                   role of the most common cell in bone, the osteocyte
                   (OCy), in cancer biology. In this study we explored
                   the crosstalk between PCa cells and OCys to determine
                   if it contributes to PCa progression. PCa cells
                   induced OCys to promote PCa proliferation, migration
                   and invasion. A chemokine screen revealed that PCa
                   cell induced OCys to produce growth-derived factor 15
                   (GDF15). Knockdown of GDF15 in OCys demonstrated that
                   PCa cells conferred the ability on OCys to promote
                   PCa proliferation, migration and invasion through
                   GDF15. Consistent with this finding was the
                   observation that the GDF15 receptor, GFRAL, was
                   expressed on multiple PCa cell lines. Transcription
                   factor array screening of PCa cells exposed to OCys
                   with or without knockdown of GDF15 revealed that
                   GDF15 in OCys promoted early growth response 1 (EGR1)
                   expression in the PCa cells. Knockdown of EGR1
                   expression in PCa cells revealed it was required for
                   the OCy-derived GDF15-mediated induction of in vitro
                   PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
                   Subcutaneous co-injection of PCa cells and OCys into
                   mice revealed that OCys promoted tumor growth in
                   vivo, which was diminished by knockdown of GDF15 in
                   the OCys. Knockdown of GDF15 in the tibiae diminished
                   growth of PCa cancer cells injected into the tibiae,

  abstract =      {All B cell leukaemias and a substantial fraction of
                   lymphomas display a natural niche residency in the
                   bone marrow. While the bone marrow compartment may
                   only be one of several sites of disease
                   manifestations, the strong clinical significance of
                   minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow
                   strongly suggests that privileged niches exist in
                   this anatomical site favouring central elements of
                   malignant transformation. Here, the co-existence of
                   two hierarchical systems, originating from
                   haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells, has
                   extensively been characterised with regard to
                   regulation of the former (blood production) by the
                   latter. How these two systems cooperate under
                   pathological conditions is far less understood and is
                   the focus of many current investigations. More recent
                   single-cell sequencing techniques have now identified
                   an unappreciated cellular heterogeneity of the bone
                   marrow microenvironment. How each of these cell
                   subtypes interact with each other and regulate normal
                   and malignant haematopoiesis remains to be
                   investigated. Here we review the evidences of how
                   bone marrow stroma cells and malignant B cells
                   reciprocally interact. Evidently from published data,
                   these cell--cell interactions induce profound changes
                   in signalling, gene expression and metabolic
                   adaptations. While the past research has largely
                   focussed on understanding changes imposed by stroma-
                   on tumour cells, it is now clear that tumour-cell
                   contact also has fundamental ramifications for the
                   biology of stroma cells. Their careful
                   characterisations are not only interesting from a
                   scientific biological viewpoint but also relevant to
                   clinical practice: Since tumour cells heavily depend
                   on stroma cells for cell survival, proliferation and
                   dissemination, interference with bone marrow
                   stroma--tumour interactions bear therapeutic
                   potential. The molecular characterisation of
                   tumour--stroma interactions can identify new
                   vulnerabilities, which could be therapeutically
                   exploited.},

                   sources. Human MSCs (hMSCs) are the

                   well ectodermal (neurocytes) and endodermal lineages
                   (hepatocytes). MSCs express cell surface markers like

                   divide to make more stem cells, perpetuating the stem
                   cell pool throughout life. Self-renewal is division
                   with maintenance of the undifferentiated state. This
                   requires cell cycle control and often maintenance of
                   multipotency or pluripotency, depending on the stem
                   cell. Self-renewal programs involve networks that
                   balance proto-oncogenes (promoting self-renewal),
                   gate-keeping tumor suppressors (limiting
                   self-renewal), and care-taking tumor suppressors
                   (maintaining genomic integrity). These cell-intrinsic
                   mechanisms are regulated by cell-extrinsic signals
                   from the niche, the microenvironment that maintains
                   stem cells and regulates their function in tissues.
                   In response to changing tissue demands, stem cells
                   undergo changes in cell cycle status and
                   developmental potential over time, requiring
                   different self-renewal programs at different stages
                   of life. Reduced stem cell function and tissue
                   regenerative capacity during aging are caused by
                   changes in self-renewal programs that augment tumor
                   suppression. Cancer arises from mutations that

                   Indeed, many stem cells are polarized within their

                   characteristic of stem cells is their ability to
                   divide asymmetrically. Recent advances in inducible
                   genetic labeling provided ample evidence that
                   symmetric stem cell divisions play an important role
                   in adult mammalian homeostasis. It is well understood
                   that the two types of cell divisions differ in terms
                   of the stem cells' flexibility to expand when needed.
                   On the contrary, the implications of symmetric and
                   asymmetric divisions for mutation accumulation are
                   still poorly understood. In this paper we study a
                   stochastic model of a renewing tissue, and address
                   the optimization problem of tissue architecture in
                   the context of mutant production. Specifically, we
                   study the process of tumor suppressor gene
                   inactivation which usually takes place as a
                   consequence of two ``hits'', and which is one of the
                   most common patterns in carcinogenesis. We compare
                   and contrast symmetric and asymmetric (and mixed)
                   stem cell divisions, and focus on the rate at which
                   double-hit mutants are generated. It turns out that
                   symmetrically-dividing cells generate such mutants at
                   a rate which is significantly lower than that of
                   asymmetrically-dividing cells. This result holds
                   whether single-hit (intermediate) mutants are
                   disadvantageous, neutral, or advantageous. It is also
                   independent on whether the carcinogenic double-hit
                   mutants are produced only among the stem cells or
                   also among more specialized cells. We argue that
                   symmetric stem cell divisions in mammals could be an
                   adaptation which helps delay the onset of cancers. We
                   further investigate the question of the optimal
                   fraction of stem cells in the tissue, and quantify
                   the contribution of non-stem cells in mutant
                   production. Our work provides a hypothesis to explain
                   the observation that in mammalian cells, symmetric
                   patterns of stem cell division seem to be very
                   common.},

  abstract =      {Various somatic stem cells divide asymmetrically;
                   however, it is not known whether embryonic stem cells
                   (ESCs) divide symmetrically or asymmetrically, not
                   only while maintaining an undifferentiated state but
                   also at the onset of differentiation. In this study,
                   we observed single ESCs using time-lapse imaging and
                   compared sister cell pairs derived from the same
                   mother cell in either the maintenance or
                   differentiation medium. Mouse ESCs were cultured on
                   E-cadherin-coated glass-based dishes, which allowed
                   us to trace single cells. The undifferentiated cell
                   state was detected by green fluorescent protein (GFP)
                   expression driven by the Nanog promoter, which is
                   active only in undifferentiated cells. Cell
                   population analysis using flow cytometry showed that
                   the peak width indicating distribution of GFP
                   expression broadened when cells were transferred to
                   the differentiation medium compared to when they were
                   in the maintenance medium. This finding suggested
                   that the population of ESCs became more heterogeneous
                   at the onset of differentiation. Using single-cell
                   analysis by time-lapse imaging, we found that
                   although the total survival ratio decreased by
                   changing to differentiation medium, the
                   one-live-one-dead ratio of sister cell pairs was
                   smaller compared with randomly chosen non-sister cell
                   pairs, defined as an unsynchronized cell pair
                   control, in both media. This result suggested that
                   sister cell pairs were more positively synchronized
                   with each other compared to non-sister cell pairs.
                   The differences in interdivision time (the time
                   interval between mother cell division and the
                   subsequent cell division) between sister cells was
                   smaller than that between non-sister cell pairs in
                   both media, suggesting that sister cells divided
                   synchronously. Although the difference in Nanog-GFP
                   intensity between sister cells was smaller than that
                   between non-sister cells in the maintenance medium,
                   it was the same in differentiation medium, suggesting
                   asymmetrical Nanog-GFP intensity. These data
                   suggested that ESCs may divide asymmetrically at the
                   onset of differentiation resulting in heterogeneity.},

                   important regulator of gene expression. Although
                   dynamic chromatin structures have been identified in
                   the genome, the full scope of chromatin dynamics
                   during mammalian development and lineage
                   specification remains to be determined. By mapping
                   genome-wide chromatin interactions in human embryonic
                   stem (ES) cells and four human ES-cell-derived
                   lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin
                   reorganization during lineage specification. We
                   observe that although self-associating chromatin
                   domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin
                   interactions both within and between domains change
                   in a striking manner, altering 36\% of active and
                   inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the
                   genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps
                   with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome
                   data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene
                   expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin
                   states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our

                   investigate epigenetic regulation of embryonic

                   cells into mesendoderm, neural progenitor cells,

                   the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental
                   switch, we have conducted deep sequencing of the 3D
                   genome, epigenome, and transcriptome of fetal and
                   adult HSCs in mouse. We find that chromosomal

                   (TADs) are largely conserved between fetal and adult
                   HSCs. However, there is a global trend of increased
                   compartmentalization and TAD boundary strength in
                   adult HSCs. In contrast, intra-TAD chromatin
                   interactions are much more dynamic and wide-spread,

                   different sets of transcription factors, such as TCF3

                   organization is largely conserved, but a large
                   fraction of enhancer-promoter interactions is
                   reorganized and regulate genes contributing to the

                   chondrogenic, adipogenic and myogenic

                   ability to maintain the differentiation toward the

                   source for autologous transplantation, cellular and
                   molecular signaling pathways and micro-environmental
                   changes have been studied in order to understand the
                   role of cytokines, chemokines, and transcription

                   differentiation of MSC into a mesenchymal lineage is

                   of essential cell sources for treating regenerative
                   diseases. Among many stem cells, the feasibility of
                   using adult-derived hematopoietic stem cells in
                   therapeutic approaches is very diverse, and is
                   unarguably regarded as an important cell source in
                   stem cell biology. So far, many investigators are
                   exploring HSCs and modified HSCs for use in clinical
                   and basic science. In the present review, we briefly
                   summarized HSCs and their application in
                   pathophysiologic conditions, including
                   non-hematopoietic tissue regeneration as well as
                   blood disorders. HSCs and HSCs-derived progenitors
                   are promising cell sources in regenerative medicine
                   and their contributions can be properly applied to
                   treat pathophysiologic conditions. Among many adult
                   stem cells, HSCs are a powerful tool to treat
                   patients with diseases such as hematologic
                   malignancies and liver disease. Since HSCs can be
                   differentiated into diverse progenitors including
                   endothelial progenitors, they may be useful for
                   constructing strategies for effective therapy.},

  abstract =      {The concept of a post-natal ``mesenchymal stem cell''
                   (``MSC'') originated from studies focused on bone
                   marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which are
                   non-hematopoietic adherent cells, a subset of which
                   are skeletal stem cells (SSCs), able to form
                   cartilage, bone, hematopoiesis-supportive stroma, and
                   marrow adipocytes based on rigorous clonal and
                   differentiation assays. Subsequently, it was
                   speculated that BMSCs could form other mesodermal
                   derivatives and even cell types from other germ
                   layers. Based on BMSC surface markers, representative
                   of fibroblastic cells, and imprecise differentiation
                   assays, it was further imagined that ``MSCs'' are
                   ubiquitous and equipotent. However, ``MSCs'' do not
                   have a common embryonic origin and are not a lineage,
                   but recent studies indicate that they are
                   tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells. These cells
                   share cell surface features owing to their
                   fibroblastic nature, but they are not identical. They
                   display different differentiation capacities based on
                   their tissue origin but do not
                   ``trans-differentiate'' outside of their lineage,
                   based on rigorous assays. For these reasons, the
                   ``MSC'' term should be abandoned. Tissue-specific
                   stem/progenitor cells provide the opportunity to
                   devise methods for tissue regeneration by the cells
                   themselves (tissue engineering). Their use in other
                   forms of regenerative medicine based on paracrine,
                   immunosuppressive, and immunomodulatory effects is
                   far less clear.},

                   tissue repair. However, differences in function and
                   differentiation potential exist between distinct stem
                   cell populations. Whether those differences are due
                   to donor variation, cell culture, or intrinsic
                   properties remains elusive. Therefore, we compared 3
                   cell lines isolated from 3 different niches using the
                   Affymetrix Exon Array platform: the cord
                   blood-derived neonatal unrestricted somatic stem cell
                   (USSC), adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
                   cells (BM-MSC), and adult adipose tissue-derived stem
                   cells (AdAS). While donor variation was minimal,
                   large differences between stem cells of different
                   origin were detected. BM-MSC and AdAS, outwardly
                   similar, are more closely related to each other than
                   to USSC. Interestingly, USSC expressed genes involved
                   in the cell cycle and in neurogenesis, consistent
                   with their reported neuronal differentiation
                   capacity. The BM-MSC signature indicates that they
                   are primed toward developmental processes of tissues
                   and organs derived from the mesoderm and endoderm.
                   Remarkably, AdAS appear to be highly enriched in
                   immune-related genes. Together, the data suggest that
                   the different mesenchymal stem cell types have
                   distinct gene expression profiles, reflecting their
                   origin and differentiation potential. Furthermore,
                   these differences indicate a demand for effective
                   differentiation protocols tailored to each stem cell
                   type.},

                   stem/stromal cells ("MSCs") are ubiquitous in human
                   connective tissues, can be defined by a common in
                   vitro phenotype, share a skeletogenic potential as
                   assessed by in vitro differentiation assays, and
                   coincide with ubiquitous pericytes. Using stringent
                   in vivo differentiation assays and transcriptome
                   analysis, we show that human cell populations from
                   different anatomical sources, regarded as "MSCs"
                   based on these criteria and assumptions, actually
                   differ widely in their transcriptomic signature and
                   in vivo differentiation potential. In contrast, they
                   share the capacity to guide the assembly of
                   functional microvessels in vivo, regardless of their
                   anatomical source, or in situ identity as
                   perivascular or circulating cells. This analysis
                   reveals that muscle pericytes, which are not
                   spontaneously osteochondrogenic as previously
                   claimed, may indeed coincide with an ectopic
                   perivascular subset of committed myogenic cells
                   similar to satellite cells. Cord blood-derived
                   stromal cells, on the other hand, display the unique
                   capacity to form cartilage in vivo spontaneously, in
                   addition to an assayable osteogenic capacity. These
                   data suggest the need to revise current
                   misconceptions on the origin and function of
                   so-called "MSCs," with important applicative
                   implications. The data also support the view that
                   rather than a uniform class of "MSCs," different
                   mesoderm derivatives include distinct classes of
                   tissue-specific committed progenitors, possibly of

                   mostly paraxial mesoderm, gut and notochord.
                   Embryonic ectoderm adjacent to the anterior part of

                   and neurectoderm. This pattern of colonization is
                   similar to the fate map constructed in

                   ceases to make a substantial contribution to
                   extraembryonic mesoderm. Orthotopic grafts and

                   stem cells (MSCs) exist at this time. One sees MSCs
                   as the postnatal, self-renewing, and multipotent stem
                   cells for the skeleton. This cell coincides with a
                   specific type of bone marrow perivascular cell. In
                   skeletal physiology, this skeletal stem cell is
                   pivotal to the growth and lifelong turnover of bone
                   and to its native regeneration capacity. In
                   hematopoietic physiology, its role as a key player in
                   maintaining hematopoietic stem cells in their niche
                   and in regulating the hematopoietic microenvironment
                   is emerging. In the alternative description, MSCs are
                   ubiquitous in connective tissues and are defined by
                   in vitro characteristics and by their use in therapy,
                   which rests on their ability to modulate the function
                   of host tissues rather than on stem cell properties.
                   Here, I discuss how the two views developed,

                   clarify the confusion arising from their collision.},

                   sorting, based on their expression of the STRO-1

                   the induction of alkaline phosphatase expression, by
                   the formation of a mineralized matrix
                   (hydroxyapatite), and by the production of the
                   bone-specific protein osteocalcin. STRO-1+ cells were

                   mumol/L), and inorganic phosphate (PO4i; 2.9 mmol/L).
                   After 2 weeks of culture, greater than 90\% of the

                   alkaline phosphatase using a monoclonal antibody
                   specific for bone and liver alkaline phosphatase.
                   Alkaline phosphatase activity was confirmed by
                   histochemistry. A mineralized matrix developed in the
                   CFU-F cultures, after 4 weeks of culture in the
                   presence of DEX, ASC-2P, and PO4i. Mineralization was
                   confirmed by both light and electron microscopy. The
                   mineral was identified as hydroxyapatite by electron
                   dispersive x-ray microanalysis and by x-ray
                   diffraction analysis. In replicate cultures,

                   immunohistochemistry and transmission electron and
                   confocal microscopies. The expression of myogenic
                   specific genes was detected by reverse
                   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
                   real-time quantitative PCR, and DNA sequencing. The
                   MSCs were spindle-shaped with irregular processes and

                   positive for beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC),
                   desmin, and alpha-cardiac actin. When the myogenic

                   (5.0 mM), an increase in intracellular calcium
                   fluorescence was observed. Myofilament-like
                   structures were observed in electron micrographs of
                   the differentiated myogenic cells. The mRNAs of
                   beta-MHC, desmin, alpha-cardiac actin, and cardiac
                   troponin T were highly expressed in the myogenic

                   LMX1a, which was reported to be a key player in
                   dopaminergic differentiation in both developmental
                   animal models and embryonic stem cells. Transduction
                   of cells with fluorescent reporter genes confirmed
                   efficiency of gene delivery. On incubation of the
                   LMX1a transduced cells in differentiation medium, the
                   LMX1a protein was concentrated in the cells' nuclei
                   and specific dopaminergic developmental genes were
                   upregulated. Moreover, the transduced cells expressed
                   higher levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate
                   limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, and secreted
                   significantly higher level of dopamine in comparison
                   to nontransduced cells. We hereby present a novel
                   strategy to facilitate the dopaminergic
                   differentiation of bone marrow-derived MSCs as a
                   possible cell source for autologous transplantation

                   whether human MSCs secrete factors which protect
                   cultured rodent cortical neurons from death by
                   trophic factor withdrawal or nitric oxide (NO)
                   exposure. Medium conditioned by MSCs attenuated
                   neuronal death under these conditions, a process
                   which was dependent on intact PI(3)kinase/Akt pathway
                   signaling. Trophic withdrawal and NO exposure in
                   cultured cortical neurons led to reduction in Akt
                   signaling pathways, whereas NO administration
                   activated p38 MAPkinase in neuronal cultures.
                   Addition of MSC-conditioned medium significantly
                   activated the PI3kinase/Akt pathway and in neurons
                   exposed to NO, MSC-conditioned medium reduced p38
                   signaling. We show that MSCs secrete brain-derived
                   neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and addition of anti-BDNF
                   neutralising antibodies to MSC-conditioned medium
                   attenuated its neuroprotective effect. Exposure of
                   neurons to BDNF increased activation of Akt pathways
                   and protected neurons from trophic factor withdrawal.
                   These observations determine the mechanisms of
                   neuroprotection offered by MSC-derived factors and

                   rejection following pancreatic or islet
                   transplantation. Bone marrow cells were obtained from
                   three adult type 2 diabetic volunteers and three
                   nondiabetic donors. After 3 days in culture, adherent
                   MSCs were expanded for two passages. At passage 3,
                   differentiation was carried out in a three-staged
                   procedure. Cells were cultured in a glucose-rich
                   medium containing several activation and growth
                   factors. Cells were evaluated in vitro by flow
                   cytometry, immunolabeling, RT-PCR, and human insulin
                   and c-peptide release in responses to increasing
                   glucose concentrations. One thousand cell clusters
                   were inserted under the renal capsule of diabetic
                   nude mice followed by monitoring of their diabetic
                   status. At the end of differentiation, approximately
                   5-10\% of cells were immunofluorescent for insulin,
                   c-peptide or glucagon; insulin, and c-peptide were
                   coexpressed. Nanogold immunolabeling for electron
                   microscopy demonstrated the presence of c-peptide in
                   the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Insulin-producing
                   cells (IPCs) expressed transcription factors and
                   genes of pancreatic hormones similar to those
                   expressed by pancreatic islets. There was a stepwise
                   increase in human insulin and c-peptide release by
                   IPCs in response to increasing glucose
                   concentrations. Transplantation of IPCs into nude
                   diabetic mice resulted in control of their diabetic
                   status for 3 months. The sera of IPC-transplanted
                   mice contained human insulin and c-peptide but
                   negligible levels of mouse insulin. When the
                   IPC-bearing kidneys were removed, rapid return of
                   diabetic state was noted. BM-MSCs from diabetic and
                   nondiabetic human subjects could be differentiated
                   without genetic manipulation to form IPCs that, when
                   transplanted, could maintain euglycemia in diabetic
                   mice for 3 months. Optimization of the culture
                   conditions are required to improve the yield of IPCs
                   and their functional performance.},

                   sublethal dose of acetaminophen (APAP) to induce
                   acute liver injury. APAP induced a time- and
                   dose-dependent damage of perivenous areas of the
                   liver lobule. Serum levels of aspartate
                   aminotransferase (AST) increased to similar levels

                   resided in the damaged perivenous areas of the liver
                   lobules short-term preventing apoptosis and thus
                   progress of organ destruction. Disturbance of
                   metabolic protein expression was lower in the livers
                   receiving hMSC-HC. Seven weeks after APAP treatment,
                   hepatic injury had completely recovered in groups

                   acetaminophen. They hence may serve as a novel source

                   which can give rise to mesenchymal and

                   in vitro properties such as (trans)differentiation
                   capabilities are well known, there is little
                   information regarding natural distribution and
                   biology in the living organism. To investigate the
                   subject further, we generated long-term cultures of
                   cells with mesenchymal stem cell characteristics from
                   different organs and tissues from adult mice. These
                   populations have morphology, immunophenotype and
                   growth properties similar to bone marrow-derived
                   MSCs. The differentiation potential was related to
                   the tissue of origin. The results indicate that (1)
                   cells with mesenchymal stem characteristics can be
                   derived and propagated in vitro from different organs
                   and tissues (brain, spleen, liver, kidney, lung, bone
                   marrow, muscle, thymus, pancreas); (2) MSC long-term
                   cultures can be generated from large blood vessels
                   such as the aorta artery and the vena cava, as well
                   as from small vessels such as those from kidney
                   glomeruli; (3) MSCs are not detected in peripheral
                   blood. Taken together, these results suggest that the
                   distribution of MSCs throughout the post-natal
                   organism is related to their existence in a
                   perivascular niche. These findings have implications
                   for understanding MSC biology, and for clinical and

                   generated markedly increasing interest in a wide
                   variety of biomedical disciplines. However,
                   investigators report studies of MSC using different
                   methods of isolation and expansion, and different
                   approaches to characterizing the cells. Thus it is
                   increasingly difficult to compare and contrast study
                   outcomes, which hinders progress in the field. To
                   begin to address this issue, the Mesenchymal and
                   Tissue Stem Cell Committee of the International
                   Society for Cellular Therapy proposes minimal
                   criteria to define human MSC. First, MSC must be
                   plastic-adherent when maintained in standard culture
                   conditions. Second, MSC must express CD105, CD73 and
                   CD90, and lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or
                   CD11b, CD79alpha or CD19 and HLA-DR surface
                   molecules. Third, MSC must differentiate to
                   osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondroblasts in vitro.
                   While these criteria will probably require
                   modification as new knowledge unfolds, we believe
                   this minimal set of standard criteria will foster a
                   more uniform characterization of MSC and facilitate
                   the exchange of data among investigators.},

                   therapies is one of the most promising approaches to
                   repair tissues. Multipotent mesenchymal stem/stromal
                   cells (MSC), a population of progenitors committing
                   into mesoderm lineages, are progressively
                   demonstrating therapeutic capabilities far beyond
                   their differentiation capacities. The mechanisms by
                   which MSC exert these actions include the release of
                   biomolecules with anti-inflammatory,
                   immunomodulating, anti-fibrogenic, and trophic
                   functions. While we expect the spectra of these
                   molecules with a therapeutic profile to progressively
                   expand, several human pathological conditions have
                   begun to benefit from these biomolecule-delivering
                   properties. In addition, MSC have also been proposed
                   to vehicle genes capable of further empowering these
                   functions. This review deals with the therapeutic
                   properties of MSC, focusing on their ability to
                   secrete naturally produced or gene-induced factors
                   that can be used in the treatment of kidney, lung,
                   heart, liver, pancreas, nervous system, and skeletal
                   diseases. We specifically focus on the different
                   modalities by which MSC can exert these functions. We

                   and disability. Ischemia triggers a cascade of events
                   leading to cell death and cerebral infarction.
                   Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a promising
                   treatment modality to promote the development of
                   nerve and blood vessels and improve nerve function.
                   However, MSCs have a limited therapeutic effect in
                   the harsh microenvironment of ischemic brain tissue.
                   Modified MSC therapy shows better therapeutic effect
                   under different pathological conditions, and is
                   expected to be translated into clinical practice. In
                   this article, we review the latest advances in the
                   development of modified MSCs for the treatment of

                   tumor-promoting features. Although several
                   transcriptome analyses of myeloma patient-derived
                   mesenchymal stem cells have displayed differences
                   compared to their healthy counterparts, these
                   analyses insufficiently reflect the signatures

                   methodologies, and lack results in lineage-committed
                   precursors. To determine tumor cell contact-mediated
                   changes on skeletal precursors, we performed
                   transcriptome analyses of mesenchymal stem cells and
                   osteogenic precursor cells cultured in contact with
                   the myeloma cell line INA-6. Comparative analyses
                   confirmed dysregulation of genes which code for known

                   upregulation of genes that are associated with plasma
                   cell homing, adhesion, osteoclastogenesis, and
                   angiogenesis. Osteoclast-derived coupling factors, a

                   tumor microenvironment, especially for bone marrow
                   mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), in the maintenance and
                   progression of multiple myeloma (MM), through direct
                   and indirect interactions with tumor plasma cells.
                   Thus, this study aimed to investigate the gene
                   expression and functional alterations of MSC from MM
                   patients (MM-MSC) in comparison with their normal
                   counterparts from normal donors (ND-MSC). Gene
                   expression analysis (Affymetrix) was performed in
                   MM-MSC and ND-MSC after in vitro expansion. To
                   validate these findings, some genes were selected to
                   be evaluated by quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR),
                   and also functional in vitro analyses were performed.
                   We demonstrated that MM-MSC have a distinct gene
                   expression profile than ND-MSC, with 485
                   differentially expressed genes (DEG) - 280
                   upregulated and 205 downregulated. Bioinformatics
                   analyses revealed that the main enriched functions
                   among downregulated DEG were related to cell cycle
                   progression, immune response activation and bone
                   metabolism. Four genes were validated by qPCR -
                   ZNF521 and SEMA3A, which are involved in bone
                   metabolism, and HLA-DRA and CHIRL1, which are
                   implicated in the activation of immune response.
                   Taken together, our results suggest that MM-MSC have
                   constitutive abnormalities that remain present even
                   in the absence of tumors cells. The alterations found
                   in cell cycle progression, immune system activation,
                   and osteoblastogenesis suggest, respectively, that
                   MM-MSC are permanently dependent of tumor cells,
                   might contribute to immune evasion and play an
                   essential role in bone lesions frequently found in MM

                   bone turnover. It renews the old bone piece by piece
                   and thus ensures the correction of possible
                   microdamage and enables the regulation of mineral
                   homeostasis. The basic mechanism of bone remodelling
                   is similar in all types of bone and includes the
                   resorption of old bone and the formation of equal
                   amount of new bone at the same place.
                   Histomorphometric studies have revealed the cellular
                   details of remodelling and have shown that it is
                   composed by the temporally and spatially regulated
                   action of different bone cells and their precursors.
                   Recent in vitro studies with osteoclasts and
                   osteoblasts have increased our knowledge of the
                   molecular mechanisms of bone remodelling. Molecular
                   characterization of bone matrix proteins have
                   suggested new functions to many of them and thereby
                   increased our possibilities of understanding the
                   local regulation mechanisms of remodelling. Bone
                   matrix has been shown to contain several biologically
                   active compounds which have effects on bone forming
                   and resorbing cells and their precursors. Details of
                   the functional mechanism of osteoclasts are also in
                   the process of being discovered. However, several
                   questions concerning bone remodelling still remain
                   open: the molecular explanation for selection of the
                   remodelling site; the coupling of bone resorption to
                   formation, and the interactions between different
                   cell types during the remodelling cycle.},

                   cytogenetic abnormalities. Approximately 55--60\% of

                   a better prognosis than those with non-hyperdiploid
                   disease. Most non-hyperdiploid tumours have IgH

                   and provided the framework for a genetically based
                   prognostic classification of multiple myeloma.These
                   constitutive genetic alterations in multiple myeloma
                   cells and changes in gene-expression profiles mediate
                   the protective effects of the bone marrow
                   microenvironment on multiple myeloma cells.Multiple
                   myeloma cells that home to the bone marrow have
                   important functional sequelae. Specifically, the
                   adhesion of multiple myeloma cells to extracellular
                   matrix proteins confers cell adhesion-mediated drug
                   resistance (CAMDR), and the binding of multiple
                   myeloma cells to bone marrow accessory cells triggers
                   the secretion of cytokines, which not only promote
                   growth, survival and migration of multiple myeloma
                   cells, but also confer resistance to conventional
                   chemotherapy. Targeting these mechanisms offers a
                   potential therapeutic strategy to overcome drug
                   resistance.Several factors, including MIP1{$\alpha$}
                   and RANKL, stimulate osteoclast activity; on the
                   other hand, DKK1 inhibits osteoblastogenesis in
                   multiple myeloma. This imbalance between bone
                   formation and resorption results in osteolytic
                   lesions, which are a hallmark of multiple myeloma.New
                   agents that target multiple myeloma cells,
                   tumour--bone marrow interactions, or the bone marrow
                   milieu, used alone or in combination, have shown
                   promise in overcoming conventional drug resistance
                   and improving patient outcome in multiple myeloma.

                   process. During the last years, osteocytes have
                   emerged as key regulators of bone loss in myeloma
                   through direct interactions with the myeloma cells.
                   The myeloma-induced crosstalk among the molecular
                   pathways establishes a positive feedback that
                   sustains myeloma cell survival and continuous bone
                   destruction, even when a plateau phase of the disease
                   has been achieved. Targeted therapies, based on the
                   better knowledge of the biology, constitute a
                   promising approach in the management of
                   myeloma-related bone disease and several novel agents
                   are currently under investigation. Herein, we provide
                   an insight into the underlying pathogenesis of bone
                   disease and discuss possible directions for future

                   (MIP-1alpha), an osteoclast (OCL) stimulatory factor
                   produced by primary multiple myeloma (MM) cells,
                   increases bone destruction and tumor burden in murine
                   models of MM. Several chemokine receptors (CCR1,
                   CCR5, and CCR9) mediate the effects of MIP-1alpha. In
                   this study, we determined which of these mediates the
                   effects of MIP-1alpha on human OCL formation and
                   myeloma cells. METHODS: We employed RT-PCR analysis,
                   neutralizing antibodies to CCR1 and CCR5 as well as a
                   CCR1-specific antagonist and OCL formation assays to
                   identify the MIP-1alpha receptors involved in
                   MIP-1alpha's effects on myeloma cells and OCL
                   formation. RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that
                   both CCR1 and CCR5 were expressed by highly purified
                   human OCL precursors, myeloma cell lines, and
                   purified marrow plasma cells from MM patients.
                   Neutralizing antibodies to CCR1 or CCR5 inhibited
                   MIP-1alpha-induced OCL formation. Furthermore,
                   monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3), which binds
                   CCR1 but not CCR5 and the CCR1-specific antagonist,
                   BX471, markedly inhibited OCL formation stimulated
                   with MIP-1alpha. Anti-CCR1, anti-CCR5, or BX471 also
                   inhibited the upregulation of beta1 integrin mRNA in
                   myeloma cells induced by MIP-1alpha, as well as the
                   adherence of myeloma cells to stromal cells and IL-6
                   production by stromal cells in response to myeloma
                   cells. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that
                   MIP-1alpha utilizes either CCR1 or CCR5 for its
                   effects on OCL formation and myeloma cells, and that
                   blocking either CCR1 or CCR5 inhibits OCL formation
                   and myeloma cell adhesion to stromal cells.},

                   factors induce osteoclast differentiation and

                   enhanced expression of receptor activator of nuclear
                   factor {$\kappa$}B ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts and
                   bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Hepatocyte growth
                   factor (HGF) is elevated in MM patients and is
                   associated with MM-induced bone disease, although the
                   mechanism by which HGF promotes bone disease remains
                   unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that
                   HGF induces RANKL expression in osteoblasts and
                   BMSCs, and investigated the mechanism of induction.
                   We found that HGF and MM cell supernatants induced
                   RANKL expression in ST2 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, and
                   mouse BMSCs. In addition, HGF increased
                   phosphorylation of Met and nuclear factor {$\kappa$}B
                   (NF-{$\kappa$}B) in ST2 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, or
                   mouse BMSCs. Moreover, Met and NF-{$\kappa$}B
                   inhibitors suppressed HGF-induced RANKL expression in
                   ST2 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, and mouse BMSCs. These
                   results indicated that HGF promotes RANKL expression
                   in osteoblasts and BMSCs via the Met/NF-{$\kappa$}B
                   signaling pathway, and Met and NF-{$\kappa$}B
                   inhibitors suppressed HGF-induced RANKL expression.
                   Our findings suggest that Met and NF-{$\kappa$}B
                   inhibitors are potentially useful in mitigating

                   transcription factors play a key role in the
                   pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM). The survival,
                   proliferation and chemoresistance of malignant plasma
                   cells largely rely on the activation of canonical and
                   noncanonical NF-{$\kappa$}B pathways. They are
                   triggered by cancer-associated mutations or by the
                   autocrine and paracrine production of cytokines and
                   growth factors as well as direct interaction with
                   cellular and noncellular components of bone marrow
                   microenvironment (BM). In this context,
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B also significantly affects the
                   activity of noncancerous cells, including mesenchymal
                   stromal cells (MSCs), which have a critical role in
                   disease progression. Indeed, NF-{$\kappa$}B
                   transcription factors are involved in inflammatory
                   signaling that alters the functional properties of
                   these cells to support cancer evolution. Moreover,
                   they act as regulators and/or effectors of pathways
                   involved in the interplay between MSCs and MM cells.
                   The aim of this review is to analyze the role of

                   cancer, represents the second most prevalent
                   hematological malignancy. Deregulated activity of the
                   nuclear factor kappaB (NF-{$\kappa$}B) family of
                   transcription factors has been implicated in the
                   pathogenesis of multiple myeloma. Tumor
                   microenvironment-derived cytokines and
                   cancer-associated genetic mutations signal through
                   the canonical as well as the non-canonical arms to
                   activate the NF-{$\kappa$}B system in myeloma cells.
                   In fact, frequent engagement of both the
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B pathways constitutes a distinguishing
                   characteristic of myeloma. In turn, NF-{$\kappa$}B
                   signaling promotes proliferation, survival and
                   drug-resistance of myeloma cells. In this review
                   article, we catalog NF-{$\kappa$}B activating genetic
                   mutations and microenvironmental cues associated with
                   multiple myeloma. We then describe how the individual
                   canonical and non-canonical pathways transduce
                   signals and contribute towards NF-{$\kappa$}B -driven
                   gene-expressions in healthy and malignant cells.
                   Furthermore, we discuss signaling crosstalk between
                   concomitantly triggered NF-{$\kappa$}B pathways, and
                   its plausible implication for anomalous
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B activation and NF-{$\kappa$}B driven
                   pro-survival gene-expressions in multiple myeloma.
                   Finally, we propose that mechanistic understanding of
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B deregulations may provide for improved
                   therapeutic and prognostic tools in multiple

                   impediment for therapeutic intervention in multiple
                   myeloma. Tumor-promoting cytokines, such as tumor
                   necrosis factor (TNF), induce nuclear
                   factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF{$\kappa$}B)- driven expression
                   of pro-survival factors, which confer resistance in
                   myeloma cells to apoptotic insults from TNF-related
                   apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and other
                   chemotherapeutic drugs. It is thought that RelA:p50
                   dimer, activated from
                   I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$}-inhibited complex in response
                   to TNF-induced canonical NF{$\kappa$}B signal,
                   mediates the pro-survival NF{$\kappa$}B function in
                   cancerous cells. Myeloma cells additionally acquire
                   gain-of-function mutations in the non-canonical
                   NF{$\kappa$}B module, which induces partial
                   proteolysis of p100 into p52 to promote
                   RelB:p52/NF{$\kappa$}B activation from p100-inhibited
                   complex during immune cell differentiation. However,
                   role of non-canonical NF{$\kappa$}B signaling in the
                   drug resistance in multiple myeloma remains unclear.
                   Here we report that myeloma-associated non-canonical
                   aberrations reinforce pro-survival TNF signaling in
                   producing a protracted TRAIL-refractory state. These
                   mutations did not act through a typical p52
                   NF{$\kappa$}B complex, but completely degraded p100
                   to reposition RelB under I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$}
                   control, whose degradation during TNF signaling
                   induced an early RelB:p50 containing NF{$\kappa$}B
                   activity. More so, autoregulatory RelB synthesis
                   prolonged this TNF-induced RelB:p50 activity in
                   myeloma cells harboring non-canonical mutations.
                   Intriguingly, TNF-activated RelB:p50 dimer was both
                   necessary and sufficient, and RelA was not required,
                   for NF{$\kappa$}B-dependent pro-survival gene
                   expressions and suppression of apoptosis. Indeed,
                   high RelB mRNA expressions in myeloma patients
                   correlated with the augmented level of pro-survival
                   factors and resistance to therapeutic intervention.
                   In sum, we provide evidence that cancer-associated
                   mutations perpetuate TNF-induced pro-survival
                   NF{$\kappa$}B activity through autoregulatory RelB
                   control and thereby exacerbate environmental drug
                   resistance in multiple myeloma.},

                   greater increase in expression, 11 have been reported
                   to be regulated by the nuclear factor-kappa B
                   (NF-{$\kappa$}B) family of transcription factors.
                   EMSA analysis demonstrated NF-{$\kappa$}B binding
                   activity significantly increased in cells adhered to
                   fibronectin compared to cells in suspension. This DNA
                   binding activity consisted primarily of RelB-p50
                   heterodimers, which was distinct from the
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B activation of TNF{$\alpha$}. These
                   data demonstrate the selectivity of signal
                   transduction from the microenvironment that may
                   contribute to tumor cell resistance to programmed

                   marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) not only localizes MM
                   cells in the marrow microenvironment, but also
                   triggers interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion by BMSCs and
                   related MM cell proliferation. In the present study,
                   we characterized the regulation of IL-6 gene
                   expression in BMSCs during MM cell adhesion. Adhesion
                   of ARH-77, HS-Sultan, IM-9, and U266 MM cell lines to
                   BMSCs and BMSC lines (LP 101 and AA 101) triggered
                   5-through 15-fold and 2-through 4-fold increases in
                   IL-6 secretion, respectively. IL-6 mRNA transcripts
                   were undetectable by Northern blotting in IM-9 MM
                   cells or LP 101 BMSCs cultured alone; however,
                   adherence of IM-9 cells to LP 101 cells induced a
                   transient increase in IL-6 transcripts at 6 hours,
                   followed by peak IL-6 secretion at 24 hours. To
                   confirm increased IL-6 transcription and characterize
                   its regulation, LP101 BMSCs were transiently
                   transfected with full length and deletion fragments
                   of the IL-6 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol
                   acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Transient
                   transfection of LP101 BMSCs with plasmid containing
                   an intact NF-kappa B site showed a 6.8 +/- 0.4-fold
                   increase in CAT activity triggered by IM-9 MM cell
                   adhesion (n = 3, P {$<$} .05). Transfection of LP 101
                   cells with plasmid containing a single base pair
                   deletion from the NF-kapp B binding motif abolished
                   the MM adhesion-induced increase in CAT activity,
                   whereas transfection with plasmid containing three
                   copies of synthetic NF-kappa B sequence resulted in
                   an 8.1 +/- 0.7-fold increase in CAT activity related
                   to MM adhesion (n = 3, P {$<$} .05). These data
                   suggest that the NF-kappa B site is one of the
                   essential regulatory elements for MM cell
                   adhesion-induced IL-6 transcription in BMSCs.
                   Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the
                   involvement of NF-kappa B activation in regulating MM
                   adhesion-induced IL-6 transcription in BMSCs. Further
                   characterization of the upstream events in the
                   signalling cascade regulating IL-6 may not only
                   delineate mechanisms of IL-6 regulation during
                   paracrine MM cell growth, but also provide new
                   therapeutic strategies based on interruption of IL-6
                   mediated tumor cell growth.},

  abstract =      {Within the bone marrow microenvironment, mesenchymal
                   stromal cells (MSCs) are an essential precursor to
                   bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts. The balance
                   between this progenitor pool and mature cells
                   (adipocytes and osteoblasts) is often skewed by
                   disease and aging. In multiple myeloma (MM), a cancer
                   of the plasma cell that predominantly grows within
                   the bone marrow, as well as other cancers, MSCs,
                   preadipocytes, and adipocytes have been shown to
                   directly support tumor cell survival and
                   proliferation. Increasing evidence supports the idea
                   that MM-associated MSCs are distinct from healthy
                   MSCs, and their gene expression profiles may be
                   predictive of myeloma patient outcomes. Here we
                   directly investigate how MM cells affect the
                   differentiation capacity and gene expression profiles
                   of preadipocytes and bone marrow MSCs. Our studies
                   reveal that MM.1S cells cause a marked decrease in
                   lipid accumulation in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells.
                   Also, MM.1S cells or MM.1S-conditioned media altered
                   gene expression profiles of both 3T3-L1 and mouse
                   bone marrow MSCs. 3T3-L1 cells exposed to MM.1S cells
                   before adipogenic differentiation displayed gene
                   expression changes leading to significantly altered
                   pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis, the cell
                   cycle, and metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation and
                   glycolysis) after adipogenesis. MM.1S cells induced a
                   marked increase in 3T3-L1~expression~of~MM-supportive
                   genes including~Il-6~and~Cxcl12~(SDF1), which was
                   confirmed in mouse MSCs by~qRT-PCR, suggesting a
                   forward-feedback mechanism.~In vitro~experiments
                   revealed~that indirect MM exposure prior to
                   differentiation drives a senescent-like phenotype in
                   differentiating MSCs, and this trend was confirmed in
                   MM-associated~MSCs compared to MSCs from normal
                   donors. In direct co-culture, human mesenchymal stem
                   cells (hMSCs) exposed to MM.1S, RPMI-8226, and OPM-2
                   prior to and during differentiation, exhibited
                   different levels of lipid accumulation as well as
                   secreted cytokines. Combined, our results suggest
                   that MM cells can inhibit~adipogenic~differentiation
                   while stimulating expression of the senescence
                   associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and other
                   pro-myeloma molecules. This study provides insight
                   into~a novel~way in which MM cells manipulate their
                   microenvironment by altering the expression of
                   supportive cytokines and skewing the cellular
                   diversity of the marrow.},

                   multiple myeloma cells is correlated with lytic bone
                   disease in multiple myeloma. However, the
                   mechanism(s) by which DKK1 contributes to this
                   process is not clear. Herein, we analyzed the
                   functional role of canonical Wnt signaling and Dkk1
                   inhibition of this pathway in bone morphogenic
                   protein (BMP)-2-induced osteoblast differentiation.
                   Osteoblast differentiation was measured by alkaline
                   phosphatase (ALP) activity in murine (C2C12) and
                   human pre-osteoblast (hFOB1.19) and osteoblast-like
                   (Saos-2 and MG63) cell lines. Cytoplasmic
                   beta-catenin protein was separated by E-cadherin-GST
                   pull-down assay and analyzed by Western blotting. A
                   dominant negative form of beta-catenin, Dkk1 and TCF
                   reporter constructs were transfected into C2C12
                   cells. C2C12 cells were also transfected with siRNA
                   specific to LRP5/6 to knockdown receptor expression.
                   Canonical Wnt signaling was activated in these cell
                   lines in response to Wnt3a as assessed by increased
                   cytoplasmic, non-phosphorylated beta-catenin and
                   TCF/LEF transcription activity. Recombinant Dkk1 and
                   plasma from MM patients containing high levels of
                   Dkk1 blocked Wnt3a-induced beta-catenin accumulation.
                   Importantly, Dkk1 abrogated BMP-2 mediated osteoblast
                   differentiation. The requirement for Wnt signaling in
                   osteoblast differentiation was confirmed by the
                   following observations: 1) overexpression of Dkk1
                   decreased endogenous beta-catenin and ALP activity;
                   2) silencing of Wnt receptor mRNAs blocked ALP
                   activity; and 3) a dominant negative form of
                   beta-catenin eliminated BMP-2-induced ALP activity.
                   Furthermore, Wnt3a did not increase ALP activity nor
                   did BMP-2 treatment result in beta-catenin
                   stabilization indicating that cooperation between
                   these two pathways is required, but they are not
                   co-regulated by either ligand. These studies have
                   revealed that autocrine Wnt signaling in osteoblasts
                   is necessary to promote BMP-2-mediated
                   differentiation of pre-osteoblast cells, while Wnt
                   signaling alone is not capable of inducing such
                   differentiation. Dkk1 inhibits this process and may
                   be a key factor regulating pre-osteoblast
                   differentiation and myeloma bone disease.},

                   formation, is expressed by myeloma cells, that is,
                   human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) and plasma cells
                   (CD138+ cells) obtained from the bone marrow (BM) of
                   a large number of MM patients with bone disease. We
                   demonstrated that BM stromal cells (BMSCs),
                   differentiated into OBs and co-cultured with HMCLs
                   showed, compared with BMSCs alone, reduced expression

                   Moreover, in the same co-culture system, the addition
                   of neutralizing anti-sclerostin antibodies restored
                   OB functions by inducing nuclear accumulation of

  abstract =      {Both activating and null mutations of proteins
                   required for canonical WNT signaling have revealed
                   the importance of this pathway for normal skeletal
                   development. However, tissue-specific transcriptional
                   mechanisms through which WNT signaling promotes the
                   differentiation of bone-forming cells have yet to be
                   identified. Here, we address the hypothesis that
                   canonical WNT signaling and the bone-related
                   transcription factor RUNX2/CBFA1/AML3 are
                   functionally linked components of a pathway required
                   for the onset of osteoblast differentiation. Our
                   findings show that, in bone of the SFRP1 (secreted
                   frizzled-related protein-1)-null mouse, which
                   exhibits activated WNT signaling and a high bone mass
                   phenotype, there is a significant increase in
                   expression of T-cell factor (TCF)-1, Runx2, and the
                   RUNX2 target gene osteocalcin. We demonstrate by
                   mutational analysis that a functional TCF regulatory
                   element responsive to canonical WNT signaling resides
                   in the promoter of the Runx2 gene (-97 to -93). By
                   chromatin immunoprecipitation, recruitment of
                   beta-catenin and TCF1 to the endogenous Runx2 gene is
                   shown. Coexpression of TCF1 with canonical WNT
                   proteins resulted in a 2-5-fold activation of Runx2
                   promoter activity and a 7-8-fold induction of
                   endogenous mRNA in mouse pluripotent mesenchymal and
                   osteoprogenitor cells. This enhancement was abrogated
                   by SFRP1. Taken together, our results provide
                   evidence for direct regulation of Runx2 by canonical
                   WNT signaling and suggest that Runx2 is a target of
                   beta-catenin/TCF1 for the stimulation of bone
                   formation. We propose that WNT/TCF1 signaling, like
                   bone morphogenetic protein/transforming growth
                   factor-beta signaling, activates Runx2 gene
                   expression in mesenchymal cells for the control of
                   osteoblast differentiation and skeletal development.},

                   diagnosis. Managing bone disease in patients with
                   multiple myeloma is a challenge and requires a
                   multi-faceted treatment approach with medication,
                   surgery, and radiation. The established treatments
                   with intravenous or subcutaneous antiresorptives can
                   cause debilitating adverse events for patients,
                   mainly osteonecrosis of the jaw, which,
                   traditionally, has been difficult to manage. Now,
                   oral surgery is recommended and proven successful in
                   60--85\% of patients. Patients with spinal
                   involvement may benefit from surgery in the form of
                   vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for pain relief,

                   with a multimodal approach that includes
                   pharmacological therapy, physical exercise, and
                   adequate nutrition. Pharmacological therapy, to date
                   based on the administration of antiresorptive drugs,
                   such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, or
                   osteoanabolic drugs, such as teriparatide and
                   abaloparatide, has shown to be effective in reducing
                   the risk of fracture in osteoporotic patients. In the
                   context of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
                   regulate bone metabolism, the discovery of the Wnt
                   signaling pathway and its role in bone tissue
                   homeostasis has allowed the identification of
                   sclerostin as an inhibitor of osteoblastic activity
                   and simultaneously as a stimulator of osteoclastic
                   activity. Therefore, the use of a monoclonal
                   antibody, romosozumab, against this protein has been
                   tested as a potential drug with a dual action,
                   stimulating bone neo-apposition and inhibiting bone
                   resorption. The efficacy of romosozumab has been
                   demonstrated in numerous clinical trials against both
                   placebo and other drugs commonly used in the
                   treatment of patients affected by osteoporosis. The
                   advantages of this drug lie above all in its rapid
                   action which makes it particularly suitable in
                   clinical situations where it is necessary to improve
                   bone strength very quickly due to the imminent risk
                   of fragility fracture. Clinical studies and
                   guidelines suggest romosozumab as an initial drug in
                   an ideal sequential approach from osteoanabolic to
                   antiresorptive drugs. Some aspects of cardiovascular
                   safety remain to be fully investigated, therefore its
                   use in osteoporotic patients at high cardiovascular
                   risk should be avoided until further data become
                   available.},

  abstract =      {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell cancer that
                   develops in the skeleton causing profound bone
                   destruction and fractures. The bone disease is
                   mediated by increased osteoclastic bone resorption
                   and suppressed bone formation. Bisphosphonates used
                   for treatment inhibit bone resorption and prevent
                   bone loss but fail to influence bone formation and do
                   not replace lost bone, so patients continue to
                   fracture. Stimulating bone formation to increase bone
                   mass and fracture resistance is a priority; however,
                   targeting tumor-derived modulators of bone formation
                   has had limited success. Sclerostin is an
                   osteocyte-specific Wnt antagonist that inhibits bone
                   formation. We hypothesized that inhibiting sclerostin
                   would prevent development of bone disease and
                   increase resistance to fracture in MM. Sclerostin was
                   expressed in osteocytes from bones from naive and
                   myeloma-bearing mice. In contrast, sclerostin was not
                   expressed by plasma cells from 630 patients with
                   myeloma or 54 myeloma cell lines. Mice injected with
                   5TGM1-eGFP, 5T2MM, or MM1.S myeloma cells
                   demonstrated significant bone loss, which was
                   associated with a decrease in fracture resistance in
                   the vertebrae. Treatment with anti-sclerostin
                   antibody increased osteoblast numbers and bone
                   formation rate but did not inhibit bone resorption or
                   reduce tumor burden. Treatment with anti-sclerostin
                   antibody prevented myeloma-induced bone loss, reduced

                   increased osteoclastic activity and decreased
                   osteoblastic activity. Many therapeutic therapies are
                   used to treat diseases, such as chemotherapy and
                   radiotherapy. In recent years, anti-sclerostin
                   antibody treatment has been under investigation for
                   its effect on the multiple myeloma. The present study
                   was conducted to assess the effective therapeutic use
                   of anti-sclerostin antibody in the treatment of
                   multiple myeloma. The literature search was conducted
                   using PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and
                   PubMed Central using the following MeSH terms:
                   ``multiple myeloma'', ``anti-sclerostin antibody'',
                   ``ubiquitin-proteasome pathway'', ``proteasome
                   inhibitor'', ``Wnt pathway''. A total of 348 articles
                   were screened. Twenty-five out of 348 were full-text
                   articles assessed for eligibility, and four articles
                   were used in this systematic review. The Preferred
                   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
                   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the

                   that the anti-sclerostin antibody was effective in

  abstract =      {Osteocytes are the most abundant bone cells,
                   comprising more than 95\% of the cells in bone. They
                   are embedded into the bone matrix, but extensively
                   communicate among themselves and with cells on the
                   bone surface and the bone marrow through the
                   osteocytic lacunar-canalicular network. Osteocytes
                   secrete sclerostin, the product of the Sost gene, an
                   antagonist of Wnt signaling that potently inhibits
                   bone formation. Osteocytes are also a major source of
                   pro- and anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines that
                   regulate osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption,
                   including RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG). Recent
                   evidence suggests that the bone remodeling
                   compartment is disrupted in multiple myeloma (MM)
                   allowing close contact of MM cells with bone cells
                   including osteocytes. However, the consequences of
                   these interactions and the contribution of osteocytes
                   to MM bone disease are unclear. Therefore, we
                   determined if interactions between MM cells and
                   osteocytes regulate osteocytic gene expression. We
                   found that co-culture of murine MLO-A5 osteocytic
                   cells with human JJN3 MM cells up-regulated murine
                   Sost mRNA expression 2-3 fold as early as 4h, which
                   remained elevated up to 24h. Consistent with Sost
                   upregulation induced by MM cells, the expression of
                   OPG, a Wnt target gene, was decreased by 30-50\% in
                   MLO-A5 cells, resulting in an increased RANKL/OPG at
                   4h. Culture of JJN3 cells in the top and MLO-A5 cells
                   in the bottom of Boyden chambers abolished both
                   upregulation of Sost and downregulation of OPG mRNA
                   expression in osteocytic cells, demonstrating the
                   requirement of direct contact between MM cells and
                   osteocytic cells. Human Sost and OPG mRNA transcripts
                   were not detected in any of these experiments,
                   demonstrating lack of contribution of MM JJN3 cells.
                   These findings demonstrate that direct interactions
                   between osteocytes and MM cells upregulate the
                   expression of the bone formation inhibitor Sost in
                   osteocytes, which in turn decreases Wnt signaling,
                   reduces osteocytic OPG expression increasing the
                   RANKL/OPG ratio. We propose that increased
                   Sost/Sclerostin expression contributes to the
                   exacerbated bone resorption and the decreased bone
                   formation that characterizes MM induced bone disease.

                   not determined. The recommended Phase II dose was
                   declared as 10 mg/kg, based mainly on saturation
                   data. There was a general trend towards increased

                   (MSCs), which can also differentiate into adipocytes.
                   We investigated myeloma-MSC interactions and the
                   effects of such interactions on the differentiation
                   of MSCs into adipocytes or osteoblasts using

                   subunit of integrin on myeloma cells stimulated
                   vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) on MSCs,
                   leading to the activation of protein kinase C

                   consequently reduced osteoblastogenesis from MSCs,
                   thus suppressing bone formation in vitro and in vivo.
                   These findings reveal that suppressed bone formation
                   is a direct consequence of myeloma-MSC contact that
                   promotes the differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes

  abstract =      {Simple Summary Multiple myeloma is a haematological
                   malignancy due to a proliferation of clonal plasma
                   cells. The medullary milieu consists of a bone marrow
                   microenvironment comprising an assortment of cells
                   and structures supporting blood cell production in
                   the bone marrow. Epigenetic alterations can modify
                   the interplay between multiple myeloma cells and the
                   bone marrow niche. The continuous bidirectional
                   relationship between bone marrow microenvironment
                   cells and neoplastic plasma cells can be altered,
                   profoundly modifying the natural history of myeloma.
                   Our review focuses on the role of epigenetic
                   mechanisms in the development and growth of multiple
                   myeloma. It discusses the crosstalk between the
                   tumour microenvironment's epigenetic mechanisms, the
                   progression of multiple myeloma, and the onset of
                   multiple myeloma complications, such as bone disease.
                   Abstract In multiple myeloma, cells of the bone
                   marrow microenvironment have a relevant
                   responsibility in promoting the growth, survival, and
                   drug resistance of multiple myeloma plasma cells. In
                   addition to the well-recognized role of genetic
                   lesions, microenvironmental cells also present
                   deregulated epigenetic systems. However, the effect
                   of epigenetic changes in reshaping the tumour
                   microenvironment is still not well identified. An
                   assortment of epigenetic regulators, comprising
                   histone methyltransferases, histone
                   acetyltransferases, and lysine demethylases, are
                   altered in bone marrow microenvironmental cells in
                   multiple myeloma subjects participating in disease
                   progression and prognosis. Aberrant epigenetics
                   affect numerous processes correlated with the tumour
                   microenvironment, such as angiogenesis, bone
                   homeostasis, and extracellular matrix remodelling.
                   This review focuses on the interplay between
                   epigenetic alterations of the tumour milieu and
                   neoplastic cells, trying to decipher the crosstalk
                   between these cells. We also evaluate the possibility
                   of intervening specifically in modified signalling or
                   counterbalancing epigenetic mechanisms.},

                   differentiation characterizes multiple myeloma (MM)
                   bone disease and persists even when patients are in
                   long-term remission. However, the underlying
                   pathophysiology for this prolonged OB suppression is
                   unknown. Therefore, we developed a mouse MM model in
                   which the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) remained
                   unresponsive to OB differentiation signals after
                   removal of MM cells. We found that BMSCs from both
                   MM-bearing mice and MM patients had increased levels
                   of the transcriptional repressor Gfi1 compared with
                   controls and that Gfi1 was a novel transcriptional
                   repressor of the critical OB transcription factor
                   Runx2. Trichostatin-A blocked the effects of Gfi1,
                   suggesting that it induces epigenetic changes in the
                   Runx2 promoter. MM-BMSC cell-cell contact was not
                   required for MM cells to increase Gfi1 and repress
                   Runx2 levels in MC-4 before OBs or naive primary
                   BMSCs, and Gfi1 induction was blocked by
                   anti--TNF-{$\alpha$} and anti--IL-7 antibodies.
                   Importantly, BMSCs isolated from Gfi1-/- mice were
                   significantly resistant to MM-induced OB suppression.
                   Strikingly, siRNA knockdown of Gfi1 in BMSCs from MM
                   patients significantly restored expression of Runx2
                   and OB differentiation markers. Thus, Gfi1 may have
                   an important role in prolonged MM-induced OB
                   suppression and provide a new therapeutic target for
                   MM bone disease.},

                   because of persistent suppressed osteoblast
                   differentiation resulting in a high fracture risk.
                   Herein, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal
                   that multiple myeloma cells induce repressive
                   epigenetic histone changes at the Runx2 locus that
                   prevent osteoblast differentiation. The most
                   pronounced multiple myeloma-induced changes were at
                   the Runx2-P1 promoter, converting it from a poised
                   bivalent state to a repressed state. Previously, it
                   was observed that multiple myeloma induces the
                   transcription repressor GFI1 in osteoblast
                   precursors, which correlates with decreased Runx2
                   expression, thus prompting detailed characterization
                   of the multiple myeloma and TNF{$\alpha$}-dependent
                   GFI1 response element within the Runx2-P1 promoter.
                   Further analyses reveal that multiple myeloma-induced
                   GFI1 binding to Runx2 in osteoblast precursors and
                   recruitment of the histone modifiers HDAC1, LSD1, and
                   EZH2 is required to establish and maintain Runx2
                   repression in osteogenic conditions. These
                   GFI1-mediated repressive chromatin changes persist
                   even after removal of multiple myeloma. Ectopic GFI1
                   is sufficient to bind to Runx2, recruit HDAC1 and
                   EZH2, increase H3K27me3 on the gene, and prevent
                   osteogenic induction of endogenous Runx2 expression.
                   Gfi1 knockdown in MC4 cells blocked multiple
                   myeloma-induced recruitment of HDAC1 and EZH2 to
                   Runx2, acquisition of repressive chromatin
                   architecture, and suppression of osteoblast
                   differentiation. Importantly, inhibition of EZH2 or
                   HDAC1 activity in pre-osteoblasts after multiple
                   myeloma exposure in vitro or in osteoblast precursors
                   from patients with multiple myeloma reversed the
                   repressive chromatin architecture at Runx2 and
                   rescued osteoblast differentiation.Implications: This
                   study suggests that therapeutically targeting EZH2 or
                   HDAC1 activity may reverse the profound multiple
                   myeloma-induced osteoblast suppression and allow

                   by non-healing lytic bone lesions that persist even
                   after a patient has achieved a hematologic remission.
                   We previously reported that p62 (sequestosome-1) in
                   bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) is critical for the
                   formation of MM-induced signaling complexes that
                   mediate OB suppression. Importantly, XRK3F2, an
                   inhibitor of the p62-ZZ domain, blunted MM-induced
                   Runx2 suppression in vitro, and induced new bone
                   formation and remodeling in the presence of tumor in
                   vivo. Additionally, we reported that MM cells induce
                   the formation of repressive chromatin on the Runx2
                   gene in BMSC via direct binding of the
                   transcriptional repressor GFI1, which recruits the
                   histone modifiers, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and
                   Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). In this study we
                   investigated the mechanism by which blocking p62-ZZ
                   domain-dependent signaling prevents MM-induced
                   suppression of Runx2 in BMSC. XRK3F2 prevented
                   MM-induced upregulation of Gfi1 and repression of the
                   Runx2 gene when present in MM-preOB co-cultures. We
                   also show that p62-ZZ-domain blocking by XRK3F2 also
                   prevented MM conditioned media and TNF plus
                   IL7-mediated Gfi1 mRNA upregulation and the
                   concomitant Runx2 repression, indicating that
                   XRK3F2's prevention of p62-ZZ domain signaling within
                   preOB is involved in the response. Chromatin
                   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses revealed that
                   XRK3F2 decreased MM-induced GFI1 occupancy at the
                   Runx2-P1 promoter and prevented recruitment of HDAC1,
                   thus preserving the transcriptionally permissive
                   chromatin mark H3K9ac on Runx2 and allowing
                   osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, treatment of
                   MM-exposed preOB with XRK3F2 after MM removal
                   decreased GFI1 enrichment at Runx2-P1 and rescued
                   MM-induced suppression of Runx2 mRNA and its
                   downstream osteogenic gene targets together with
                   increased osteogenic differentiation. Further,
                   primary BMSC (hBMSC) from MM patients (MM-hBMSC) had
                   little ability to increase H3K9ac on the Runx2
                   promoter in osteogenic conditions when compared to
                   hBMSC from healthy donors (HD). XRK3F2 treatment
                   enriched Runx2 gene H3K9ac levels in MM-hBMSC to the
                   level observed in HD-hBMSC, but did not alter
                   HD-hBMSC H3K9ac. Importantly, XRK3F2 treatment of
                   long-term MM-hBMSC cultures rescued osteogenic
                   differentiation and mineralization. Our data show
                   that blocking p62-ZZ domain-dependent signaling with
                   XRK3F2 can reverse epigenetic-based mechanisms of
                   MM-induced Runx2 suppression and promote osteogenic

                   required for BMSC enhancement of MMBD. We recently
                   identified a novel p62-ZZ inhibitor, XRK3F2, that
                   inhibits MM cell growth and BMSC growth enhancement
                   of human MM cells. In the current study we evaluate

                   containing bones and blocked the effects and

                   NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling is constitutively activated
                   by genetic alterations or environmental signals in
                   many human cancers, where it contributes to almost
                   all hallmarks of malignancy, including sustained
                   proliferation, cell death resistance, tumor-promoting
                   inflammation, metabolic reprogramming, tissue
                   invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. As such, the
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway is an attractive therapeutic
                   target in a broad range of human cancers, as well as
                   in numerous non-malignant diseases. Currently,
                   however, there is no clinically useful NF-{$\kappa$}B
                   inhibitor to treat oncological patients, owing to the
                   preclusive, on-target toxicities of systemic
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B blockade. In this review, we discuss
                   the principal and most promising strategies being
                   developed to circumvent the inherent limitations of

                   knowledge of the effect of chemical surface
                   modifications on vital cell function in vitro is of
                   importance. Early in our investigations we recognized
                   that amino groups, positively charged via plasma
                   polymerized allylamine, increased cell growth and the
                   actin-filament formation in the initial cell-material
                   contact phase. To gain insight into continuous vital
                   cell behavior on this plasma polymer layer, here we
                   present the metabolic activity of osteoblasts and
                   their time-dependent adhesion using the sensor chip
                   technology. METHODS: We demonstrate a new method for
                   continuous 24 hour-measurements with vital human
                   osteoblast-like cells (MG-63, ATCC) on sensor chips
                   (Bionas{\textregistered} SC 1000) modified with
                   plasma polymerized allylamine (PPAAm). The PPAAm film
                   deposited on the chip is a cross-linked, strongly
                   fixed plasma polymer with relatively high amino
                   functionality and well defined chemical surface
                   composition. We assessed continuous cell adhesion and
                   the metabolic activity, i.e., oxygen consumption and
                   acidification. RESULTS: We determined that adhesion
                   of vital cells on PPAAm is not only enhanced shortly
                   (1 h) after cell seeding but remained continuously
                   higher for 24 h, which is significant. This
                   nanometer-thin PPAAm layer did not change the overall
                   metabolic activity of MG-63 cells during 24 h.
                   CONCLUSION: This tool--using adhesion and metabolic
                   sensor chips--appears to be a suitable method for the
                   recognition of vital cell physiology in
                   biocompatibility measurements of plasma chemical
                   treated surfaces.},

                   in vitro after cell contact at confluency. Here
                   retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), which lack
                   E-cadherin but express a cadherin that is also found
                   in many non-epithelial cells (N-cadherin), were
                   examined for the ability to produce an epithelial
                   phenotype in vitro. Subpopulations of grossly
                   epithelioid or fusiform cells were selected for
                   analysis from RPE cultures derived from adult human
                   donors. After confluency, epithelioid RPE cells were
                   observed to undergo time-dependent changes that were
                   similar to those previously found in epithelial cells
                   expressing E-cadherin: the cadherin gradually
                   developed a zonular distribution of
                   detergent-resistant protein that co-localized with
                   forming circumferential actin bundles; Na/K ATPase
                   accumulated at cell contact sites, then polarized to
                   its tissue-specific domain (the apical membrane for
                   RPE); the cells formed elevated domes on the
                   impermeant culture substrate. In contrast to cells
                   expressing E-cadherin, these events in RPE required
                   weeks rater than days at confluency. Additional
                   proteins were examined in epithelioid RPE cells
                   revealing that cytokeratins reorganized after
                   confluency producing a zonular array, and several
                   other adhesion proteins (alpha5beta1 integrin,
                   ICAM-1, PECAM-1, NCAM) became enriched at cell-cell
                   contact sites, each developing a distinct pattern at
                   a distinct postconfluency interval. In contrast to
                   epithelioid RPE, in fusiform RPE the adhesion
                   molecules did not develop discrete distribution
                   patterns after confluency, although the same
                   complement of adhesion proteins was expressed. In
                   cells expressing E-cadherin, the absence of
                   epithelial properties is often due to underexpression
                   of the cadherin or of the catenins, adherens junction
                   proteins that link the cadherin to actin. Fusiform
                   RPE, however, were not deficient in these proteins,
                   expressing amounts of N-cadherin, alpha-catenin,
                   beta-catenin, plakoglobin, p120, alpha-actinin and
                   vinculin that were equivalent to epithelioid cells.
                   It appears, therefore, that a subset of epithelial
                   cells that express N-cadherin can produce a
                   highly-developed epithelial phenotype in vitro
                   through a slow morphogenetic process. However, the
                   expression alone of adhesion molecules, including
                   those with a morphoregulatory function in other
                   cells, is insufficient to produce an epithelial
                   phenotype in all cells derived from the pigment
                   epithelium.},

                   Our data suggest that in motile, polarized cells,
                   RhoA--ROCK interactions prevail at the rear, whereas
                   RhoA-DIA interactions dominate at the front where
                   Rac1/ Rho oscillations drive protrusions and
                   retractions. At the rear, high RhoA and low Rac1

  abstract =      {Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a widely used
                   technique in microbial community analysis, allowing
                   the quantification of the number of target genes in a
                   community sample. Currently, the standard-curve (SC)
                   method of absolute quantification is widely employed
                   for these kinds of analysis. However, the SC method
                   assumes that the amplification efficiency (E) is the
                   same for both the standard and the sample target
                   template. We analyzed 19 bacterial strains and nine
                   environmental samples in qPCR assays, targeting the
                   nifH and 16S rRNA genes. The E values of the qPCRs
                   differed significantly, depending on the template.
                   This has major implications for the quantification.
                   If the sample and standard differ in their E values,
                   quantification errors of up to orders of magnitude
                   are possible. To address this problem, we propose and
                   test the one-point calibration (OPC) method for
                   absolute quantification. The OPC method corrects for
                   differences in E and was derived from the
                   {$\Delta\Delta$}CT method with correction for E,
                   which is commonly used for relative quantification in
                   gene expression studies. The SC and OPC methods were
                   compared by quantifying artificial template mixtures
                   from Geobacter sulfurreducens (DSM 12127) and Nostoc
                   commune (Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa
                   [CCAP] 1453/33), which differ in their E values.
                   While the SC method deviated from the expected nifH
                   gene copy number by 3- to 5-fold, the OPC method
                   quantified the template mixtures with high accuracy.
                   Moreover, analyzing environmental samples, we show
                   that even small differences in E between the standard
                   and the sample can cause significant differences
                   between the copy numbers calculated by the SC and the
                   OPC methods.},

                   scientific research over the past few years have
                   provided the scientific community with new and more
                   complex forms of data. Large data sets collected from
                   single groups or cross-institution consortiums
                   containing hundreds of omic and clinical variables
                   corresponding to thousands of patients are becoming
                   increasingly commonplace in the research setting.
                   Before any core analyses are performed, visualization
                   often plays a key role in the initial phases of
                   research, especially for projects where no initial
                   hypotheses are dominant. Proper visualization of data
                   at a high level facilitates researcher's abilities to
                   find trends, identify outliers and perform quality
                   checks. In addition, research has uncovered the
                   important role of visualization in data analysis and
                   its implied benefits facilitating our understanding
                   of disease and ultimately improving patient care. In
                   this work, we present a review of the current
                   landscape of existing tools designed to facilitate
                   the visualization of multidimensional data in
                   translational research platforms. Specifically, we
                   reviewed the biomedical literature for translational
                   platforms allowing the visualization and exploration
                   of clinical and omics data, and identified 11

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Despite continuous research efforts in
                   the past decades, there are still cancers where no
                   effective treatment is available, such as advanced
                   kidney cancer or hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
                   A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of
                   cancer development and progression is the basis for
                   the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic
                   strategies. Current developments in genomics have a
                   dramatic impact on the whole field of research. The
                   sequence of the entire human genome will soon be
                   fully sequenced and provide the 'book of life' as a
                   basis for the understanding of human disease. METHODS
                   AND RESULTS: New technologies have emerged to
                   translate the human genome sequence into gene
                   function and improved diagnostics or treatment
                   modalities. New technologies such as microarrays are
                   not only important for fundamental research, but will
                   also be useful for diagnostic, prognostic or
                   therapeutic purposes in individual patients. DNA
                   microarrays make it possible to analyze the mRNA
                   expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. The
                   resulting comprehensive gene expression surveys lead
                   to the identification of new genes and pathways with
                   importance in cancer development and progression, or
                   as targets for new therapies. The validation and
                   prioritization of genes emerging from genome
                   screening analyses in large series of clinical tumors
                   has become a new bottleneck in research. Therefore,
                   we have recently developed the tissue microarray
                   (TMA) technology to efficiently test the clinical
                   relevance of candidate genes. TMAs are microscope
                   slides containing samples from hundreds of individual
                   tumor specimens. They can be used for large-scale,
                   massively parallel in situ analysis of genetic
                   alterations on a DNA, RNA and protein level using in
                   situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry on
                   hundreds of tumor specimens at a time. Microarray
                   technologies are already increasingly being used in
                   urologic research, and will also have a strong impact
                   on clinical urology. CONCLUSIONS: DNA microarrays and
                   TMAs provide a powerful approach to identify large
                   numbers of new candidate genes, and rapidly validate
                   their clinical impact in large series of human
                   tumors. These technologies will soon lead to a better
                   molecular understanding of urologic tumors, and
                   accelerate the identification of new prognostic
                   markers or therapeutic targets.},

  abstract =      {This review examines two important aspects that are
                   central to modern big data bioinformatics analysis --
                   software scalability and validity. We argue that not
                   only are the issues of scalability and validation
                   common to all big data bioinformatics analyses, they
                   can be tackled by conceptually related methodological
                   approaches, namely divide-and-conquer (scalability)
                   and multiple executions (validation). Scalability is
                   defined as the ability for a program to scale based
                   on workload. It has always been an important
                   consideration when developing bioinformatics
                   algorithms and programs. Nonetheless the surge of
                   volume and variety of biological and biomedical data
                   has posed new challenges. We discuss how modern cloud
                   computing and big data programming frameworks such as
                   MapReduce and Spark are being used to effectively
                   implement divide-and-conquer in a distributed
                   computing environment. Validation of software is
                   another important issue in big data bioinformatics
                   that is often ignored. Software validation is the
                   process of determining whether the program under test
                   fulfils the task for which it was designed.
                   Determining the correctness of the computational
                   output of big data bioinformatics software is
                   especially difficult due to the large input space and
                   complex algorithms involved. We discuss how
                   state-of-the-art software testing techniques that are
                   based on the idea of multiple executions, such as
                   metamorphic testing, can be used to implement an
                   effective bioinformatics quality assurance strategy.
                   We hope this review will raise awareness of these
                   critical issues in bioinformatics.},

                   biochemistry, and other biosciences utilizes computer
                   programs. The computational advances have come on
                   many fronts, spurred by fundamental developments in
                   hardware, software, and algorithms. These advances
                   have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal
                   array of bioscience fields, including molecular
                   evolution and bioinformatics; genome-, proteome-,
                   transcriptome- and metabolome-wide experimental

                   simulations of cellular-scale molecular assemblies as

                   of post-genomic biology is increasingly becoming a
                   form of computational biology. The ability to design

                   indispensable skills that a modern researcher can
                   cultivate. Python has become a popular programming
                   language in the biosciences, largely because (i) its
                   straightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a
                   readily accessible first language; (ii) it is
                   expressive and well-suited to object-oriented
                   programming, as well as other modern paradigms; and
                   (iii) the many available libraries and third-party
                   toolkits extend the functionality of the core
                   language into virtually every biological domain
                   (sequence and structure analyses, phylogenomics,
                   workflow management systems, etc.). This primer
                   offers a basic introduction to coding, via Python,
                   and it includes concrete examples and exercises to
                   illustrate the language's usage and capabilities; the

  abstract =      {Summary There is increasing concern that most current
                   published research findings are false. The
                   probability that a research claim is true may depend
                   on study power and bias, the number of other studies
                   on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of
                   true to no relationships among the relationships
                   probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a
                   research finding is less likely to be true when the
                   studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect
                   sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and
                   lesser preselection of tested relationships; where
                   there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions,
                   outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater
                   financial and other interest and prejudice; and when
                   more teams are involved in a scientific field in
                   chase of statistical significance. Simulations show
                   that for most study designs and settings, it is more
                   likely for a research claim to be false than true.
                   Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed
                   research findings may often be simply accurate
                   measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I
                   discuss the implications of these problems for the

                   has been remarkable, but alongside the many
                   transformative advances is a growing concern that a
                   surprisingly high fraction of published research
                   cannot be reproduced by the scientific community.
                   Though experimental and interpretive errors are
                   unavoidable features of the scientific process,
                   recent evidence suggests that irreproducibility is a
                   serious issue requiring analysis, understanding, and
                   remediation. This article reviews the meaning of
                   research reproducibility, examines ongoing efforts to
                   estimate its prevalence, and considers the factors
                   that contribute to it. Two recent case studies
                   illustrate the disparate responses that researchers
                   may take when facing serious claims that a
                   high-profile research finding is irreproducible and
                   may be false. Finally, the article examines potential
                   interventions to counter the current level of
                   irreproducibility, aimed at increasing the efficiency
                   and impact of society's substantial and critically
                   important investment in bioscience research.},

                   knowledge and benefits to be gained from the efforts

                   the same time, sharing clinical trial data presents
                   risks, burdens, and challenges. These include the
                   need to protect the privacy and honor the consent of

                   economic interests of sponsors; and guard against

                   trust in clinical trials or otherwise harm public

                   activities and strategies for the responsible sharing

                   scientific knowledge to lead to better therapies for
                   patients, this book identifies guiding principles and
                   makes recommendations to maximize the benefits and
                   minimize risks. This report offers guidance on the
                   types of clinical trial data available at different
                   points in the process, the points in the process at
                   which each type of data should be shared, methods for
                   sharing data, what groups should have access to data,
                   and future knowledge and infrastructure needs.
                   Responsible sharing of clinical trial data will allow
                   other investigators to replicate published findings
                   and carry out additional analyses, strengthen the
                   evidence base for regulatory and clinical decisions,
                   and increase the scientific knowledge gained from
                   investments by the funders of clinical trials. The
                   recommendations of Sharing Clinical Trial Data will
                   be useful both now and well into the future as
                   improved sharing of data leads to a stronger evidence

                   assumed greater importance in the `omics' era.
                   Transparency is necessary for confirmation and
                   validation, and multiple examiners aid in extracting
                   maximal value from large datasets. Accordingly,
                   database submission and provision of the Minimum
                   Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) are
                   required by most journals as a prerequisite for
                   review or acceptance. Methods In this study, the
                   level of data submission and MIAME compliance was
                   reviewed for 127 articles that included
                   microarray-based microRNA profiling and that were
                   published from July, 2011 through April, 2012 in the
                   journals that published the largest number of such
                   articles---PLOS ONE, the Journal of Biological
                   Chemistry, Blood, and Oncogene---along with articles
                   from nine other journals, including Clinical
                   Chemistry, that published smaller numbers of
                   array-based articles. Results Overall, data
                   submission was reported at publication for less than
                   40\% of all articles, and almost 75\% of articles
                   were MIAME-noncompliant. On average, articles that
                   included full data submission scored significantly
                   higher on a quality metric than articles with limited
                   or no data submission, and studies with adequate
                   description of methods disproportionately included
                   larger numbers of experimental repeats. Finally, for
                   several articles that were not MIAME-compliant, data
                   re-analysis revealed less than complete support for
                   the published conclusions, in one case leading to
                   retraction. Conclusions These findings buttress the
                   hypothesis that reluctance to share data is
                   associated with low study quality and suggest that
                   most miRNA array investigations are underpowered
                   and/or potentially compromised by a lack of
                   appropriate reporting and data submission.},

                   In this study, a systematic approach was used to
                   sample 16 periodicals from the ISI Journal Citation
                   Report database and to collect 233 preclinical
                   articles (including both in vitro and animal
                   research) from online journal content published in
                   2019. Statistical items related to the use of
                   location tests were quantified. Results revealed that
                   a large proportion of articles insufficiently
                   describe tests (median 44.8\%, IQR [33.3--62.5\%],

                   [35.7--55.4\%]). The results further point at
                   contradictory information as a component of poor
                   reporting (18.3\%, IQR [6.79--26.7\%]). No detectable
                   correlation was found between journal impact factor
                   and the quality of statistical reporting of any
                   studied item. The under-representation of open-source
                   software (4.50\% of articles) suggests that the
                   provision of code should remain restricted to
                   articles that use such packages. Since mounting
                   evidence indicates that transparency is key for
                   reproducible science, this work highlights the need

  year =          {2014},
  abstract =      {PURPOSE: The Bonferroni correction adjusts
                   probability (p) values because of the increased risk
                   of a type I error when making multiple statistical
                   tests. The routine use of this test has been
                   criticised as deleterious to sound statistical
                   judgment, testing the wrong hypothesis, and reducing
                   the chance of a type I error but at the expense of a
                   type II error; yet it remains popular in ophthalmic
                   research. The purpose of this article was to survey
                   the use of the Bonferroni correction in research
                   articles published in three optometric journals, viz.
                   Ophthalmic \& Physiological Optics, Optometry \&
                   Vision Science, and Clinical \& Experimental
                   Optometry, and to provide advice to authors
                   contemplating multiple testing. RECENT FINDINGS: Some
                   authors ignored the problem of multiple testing while
                   others used the method uncritically with no rationale
                   or discussion. A variety of methods of correcting p
                   values were employed, the Bonferroni method being the
                   single most popular. Bonferroni was used in a variety
                   of circumstances, most commonly to correct the
                   experiment-wise error rate when using multiple 't'
                   tests or as a post-hoc procedure to correct the
                   family-wise error rate following analysis of variance
                   (anova). Some studies quoted adjusted p values
                   incorrectly or gave an erroneous rationale. SUMMARY:
                   Whether or not to use the Bonferroni correction
                   depends on the circumstances of the study. It should
                   not be used routinely and should be considered if:
                   (1) a single test of the 'universal null hypothesis'
                   (Ho ) that all tests are not significant is required,
                   (2) it is imperative to avoid a type I error, and (3)
                   a large number of tests are carried out without
                   preplanned hypotheses.},

                   impair medical decision quality and compromise
                   patient safety. Previous studies have documented
                   clinicians' insufficient proficiency in statistics
                   and a tendency in overconfidence. However, an
                   underexplored aspect is clinicians' awareness of
                   their lack of statistical knowledge that precludes
                   any corrective intervention attempt. Here, we
                   investigated physicians', residents' and medical
                   students' alignment between subjective confidence
                   judgments and objective accuracy in basic medical
                   statistics. We also examined how gender, profile of
                   experience and practice of research activity affect
                   this alignment, and the influence of problem framing
                   (conditional probabilities, CP vs. natural
                   frequencies, NF). Eight hundred ninety-eight
                   clinicians completed an online survey assessing skill
                   and confidence on three topics: vaccine efficacy, p
                   value and diagnostic test results interpretation.
                   Results evidenced an overall consistent poor
                   proficiency in statistics often combined with high
                   confidence, even in incorrect answers. We also
                   demonstrate that despite overconfidence bias,
                   clinicians show a degree of metacognitive
                   sensitivity, as their confidence judgments
                   discriminate between their correct and incorrect
                   answers. Finally, we confirm the positive impact of
                   the more intuitive NF framing on accuracy. Together,
                   our results pave the way for the development of
                   teaching recommendations and pedagogical
                   interventions such as promoting metacognition on
                   basic knowledge and statistical reasoning as well as
                   the use of NF to tackle statistical illiteracy in the
                   medical context.},

                   progress of the Journal of Open Source Software
                   (JOSS). JOSS is a free and open-access journal that
                   publishes articles describing research software. It
                   has the dual goals of improving the quality of the
                   software submitted and providing a mechanism for
                   research software developers to receive credit. While
                   designed to work within the current merit system of
                   science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key
                   contributions to science made in the form of
                   software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate
                   scholarship contained in the software itself, and its
                   rigorous peer review targets the software components:
                   functionality, documentation, tests, continuous
                   integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains
                   an abstract describing the purpose and functionality
                   of the software, references, and a link to the
                   software archive. The article is the entry point of a
                   JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of
                   software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in
                   the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors
                   work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other
                   journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring
                   major revision; while not yet accepted, articles
                   remain visible and under review until the authors
                   make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet
                   requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS
                   gives it a digital object identifier (DOI), deposits
                   its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin
                   collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar

                   samples to comprehensive clinical data, which in
                   conjunction can lead to effective therapies. From
                   such a scenario emerges the need for a new
                   professional profile, an expert bioinformatician with
                   training in clinical areas who can make sense of
                   multi-omics data to improve therapeutic interventions
                   in patients, and the design of optimized basket
                   trials. In this review, we first describe the main
                   policies and international initiatives that focus on
                   precision medicine. Secondly, we review the currently
                   ongoing clinical trials in precision medicine,
                   introducing the concept of 'precision

                   and computational infrastructures for precision
                   medicine in health institutions around the world.
                   Thirdly, we discuss the challenges related to the
                   clinical training of bioinformaticians, and the
                   urgent need for computational specialists capable of
                   assimilating medical terminologies and protocols to

                   bioinformatics and some tips for emergent groups.

                   RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved
                   problem because of the non-contiguous transcript
                   structure, relatively short read lengths and
                   constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
                   technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners
                   suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping
                   speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.,
                   Results: To align our large ({$>$}80 billon reads)
                   ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
                   the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference
                   (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed
                   RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential
                   maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix
                   arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching
                   procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a
                   factor of {$>$}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
                   human genome 550 million 2 {\texttimes} 76 bp
                   paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server,
                   while at the same time improving alignment
                   sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de
                   novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can
                   discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
                   transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
                   full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing

                   transcripts) is a highly efficient system for
                   aligning reads from RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT
                   uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler
                   transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index,
                   employing two types of indexes for alignment: a
                   whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and
                   numerous local FM indexes for very rapid extensions
                   of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for
                   the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes,
                   each representing a genomic region of
                   {\textasciitilde}64,000 bp. Tests on real and
                   simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest
                   system currently available, with equal or better
                   accuracy than any other method. Despite its large
                   number of indexes, HISAT requires only 4.3 gigabytes
                   of memory. HISAT supports genomes of any size,
                   including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

                   experiments necessitate scalable, fast and
                   mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat
                   and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools

                   analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
                   data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new
                   genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well
                   as compare gene and transcript expression under two
                   or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail
                   how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such
                   analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and
                   utilities that aid in managing data, including
                   CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis
                   results. Although the procedure assumes basic
                   informatics skills, these tools assume little to no
                   background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for
                   novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with
                   raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome
                   assembly, lists of differentially expressed and
                   regulated genes and transcripts, and
                   publication-quality visualizations of analysis
                   results. The protocol's execution time depends on the
                   volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available
                   computing resources but takes less than 1 d of
                   computer time for typical experiments and {$\sim$}1 h
                   of hands-on time.},

                   Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic

                   statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for

                   estimation for dispersions and fold changes to
                   improve stability and interpretability of estimates.
                   This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on
                   the strength rather than the mere presence of

                   of competing medical technologies and inform the
                   efficient use of healthcare resources. Historically,
                   these models have been developed with specialized
                   commercial software (such as TreeAge) or more
                   commonly with spreadsheet software (almost always
                   Microsoft Excel). Although these tools may be
                   sufficient for relatively simple analyses, they put
                   unnecessary constraints on the analysis that may
                   ultimately limit its credibility and relevance. In
                   contrast, modern programming languages such as R,
                   Python, Matlab, and Julia facilitate the development
                   of models that are (i) clinically realistic, (ii)

                   transparent and reproducible, and (iv) reusable and

                   modern software can therefore help ensure that
                   coverage and pricing decisions confer greatest
                   possible benefit and capture all scientific

                   it ready for analysis, but there has been little
                   research on how to make data cleaning as easy and
                   effective as possible. This paper tackles a small,
                   but important, component of data cleaning: data
                   tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model
                   and visualize, and have a specific structure: each
                   variable is a column, each observation is a row, and
                   each type of observational unit is a table. This
                   framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets
                   because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
                   with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure
                   also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data
                   analysis, tools that both input and output tidy
                   datasets. The advantages of a consistent data
                   structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a
                   case study free from mundane data manipulation

                   a reusability concept helps to decrease overall
                   development time. Exploiting reuse to reduce
                   development time cannot be restricted to inner
                   reusability as supported by objectoriented
                   programming; furthermore, reusability of software
                   components does not suffice to achieve reusable
                   software. This paper introduces a combination of
                   concepts that applies object-oriented and
                   componentoriented techniques together with
                   parameterization and flexible data handling.
                   Additionally, we discuss the effect of
                   standardization of some inner parts of the process
                   automation software on the reusability of the whole
                   software. We demonstrate the application of these
                   concepts with the example of the data handling part
                   of the process automation software for hot rolling
                   mills. The data handling part is the crucial part of
                   each process automation system, whose main tasks are
                   to receive measured values from the basic automation
                   system, to support mathematical model calculations
                   with these values, and to send the result values of
                   these calculations back to the basic automation
                   system to control the rolling mill. Therefore data
                   handling plays an important role in making automation
                   software reusable. Our concept involves standardizing
                   the data items while keeping the interfaces flexible.
                   The concept in this paper evolved from a study of
                   several process automation systems. This concept has
                   been used as a basis for a process automation
                   architecture for hot rolling mills developed as part
                   of an ESPRIT project. A hot rolling mill automation
                   implementation to verify these concepts is under
                   construction.},

                   five years, authors Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher
                   have analyzed hundreds of examples of "bad code"

                   a software architecture with respect to a quality
                   attribute requirement for maintainability. The report
                   introduces maintainability and common forms of
                   maintainability requirements for software
                   architectures. It provides a set of definitions, core
                   concepts, and a framework for reasoning about
                   maintainability and the satisfaction (or not) of
                   maintainability requirements by an architecture and,
                   eventually, a system. It describes a set of
                   mechanisms, such as patterns and tactics, that are
                   commonly used to satisfy maintainability
                   requirements. It also provides a method by which an
                   analyst can determine whether an architecture
                   documentation package provides enough information to
                   support analysis and, if so, determine whether the
                   architectural decisions contain serious risks
                   relative to maintainability requirements. An analyst
                   can use this method to determine whether those
                   requirements, represented as a set of scenarios, have
                   been sufficiently well specified to support the needs
                   of analysis. The reasoning around this quality
                   attribute should allow an analyst, armed with
                   appropriate architectural documentation, to assess
                   the risks inherent in today's architectural decisions
                   in light of tomorrow's anticipated needs.},

                   absolute measures of usability, since, if the

                   must of necessity be defined by that context too.

                   Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk
                   illustrates how to transform integration from a
                   necessary evil into an everyday part of the
                   development process. The key, as the authors show, is
                   to integrate regularly and often using continuous
                   integration (CI) practices and techniques. ~The
                   authors first examine the concept of CI and its
                   practices from the ground up and then move on to
                   explore other effective processes performed by CI
                   systems, such as database integration, testing,
                   inspection, deployment, and feedback. Through more
                   than forty CI-related practices using application
                   examples in different languages, readers learn that
                   CI leads to more rapid software development, produces
                   deployable software at every step in the development
                   lifecycle, and reduces the time between defect
                   introduction and detection, saving time and lowering
                   costs. With successful implementation of CI,
                   developers reduce risks and repetitive manual
                   processes, and teams receive better project

                   achieved a prominent role in statistics,
                   bioinformatics, and data science in general. It
                   currently ranks among the top 10 most popular
                   languages worldwide, and its community has produced

  abstract =      {Transcriptional enhancers act as docking stations for
                   combinations of transcription factors and thereby
                   regulate spatiotemporal activation of their target
                   genes1. It has been a long-standing goal in the field
                   to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer and to
                   understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene
                   expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Here
                   we show that deep learning models2--6, can be used to
                   efficiently design synthetic, cell-type-specific
                   enhancers, starting from random sequences, and that
                   this optimization process allows detailed tracing of
                   enhancer features at single-nucleotide resolution. We
                   evaluate the function of fully synthetic enhancers to
                   specifically target Kenyon cells or glial cells in
                   the fruit fly brain using transgenic animals. We
                   further exploit enhancer design to create `dual-code'
                   enhancers that target two cell types and minimal
                   enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully
                   functional. By examining the state space searches
                   towards local optima, we characterize enhancer codes
                   through the strength, combination and arrangement of
                   transcription factor activator and transcription
                   factor repressor motifs. Finally, we apply the same
                   strategies to successfully design human enhancers,
                   which adhere to enhancer rules similar to those of
                   Drosophila enhancers. Enhancer design guided by deep
                   learning leads to better understanding of how
                   enhancers work and shows that their code can be
                   exploited to manipulate cell states.},

                   informing the genetics, physiology, and ecology of
                   environmental microorganisms. Current challenges for
                   metagenomic analysis are related to our ability to
                   connect the dots between sequencing reads, their
                   population of origin, and their encoding functions.
                   Assembly-based methods reduce dataset size by
                   extending overlapping reads into larger contiguous
                   sequences (contigs), providing contextual information
                   for genetic sequences that does not rely on existing
                   references. These methods, however, tend to be
                   computationally intensive and are again challenged by
                   sequencing errors as well as by genomic repeats While
                   numerous tools have been developed based on these
                   methodological concepts, they present confounding
                   choices and training requirements to metagenomic
                   investigators. To help with accessibility to assembly
                   tools, this review also includes an IPython Notebook
                   metagenomic assembly tutorial. This tutorial has
                   instructions for execution any operating system using
                   Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute and guides users through
                   downloading, assembly, and mapping reads to contigs
                   of a mock microbiome metagenome. Despite its
                   challenges, metagenomic analysis has already revealed
                   novel insights into many environments on Earth. As
                   software, training, and data continue to emerge,
                   metagenomic data access and its discoveries will to

                   expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and
                   operating on data in vectors, matrices and
                   higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array
                   programming library for the Python language. It has
                   an essential role in research analysis pipelines in
                   fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy,
                   geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science,
                   engineering, finance and economics. For example, in
                   astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the
                   software stack used in the discovery of gravitational
                   waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2.
                   Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts
                   lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm
                   for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific
                   data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the
                   scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so
                   pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences
                   with specialized needs, have developed their own
                   NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its
                   central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly
                   acts as an interoperability layer between such array
                   computation libraries and, together with its
                   application programming interface (API), provides a
                   flexible framework to support the next decade of
                   scientific and industrial analysis.},

                   libraries and proficiency in handling large-scale
                   data, such as single-cell multi-omics datasets.
                   Although Python has become a prominent data science
                   ecosystem for bioinformatics, there remains a growing
                   demand for advanced heatmap visualization and
                   assembly tools, which are not sufficiently addressed
                   by existing Python-based data visualization

                   all-inclusive Python library for heatmap

  abstract =      {PURPOSE: This paper introduces the SciKit-Surgery
                   libraries, designed to enable rapid development of
                   clinical applications for image-guided interventions.
                   SciKit-Surgery implements a family of compact,
                   orthogonal, libraries accompanied by robust testing,
                   documentation, and quality control. SciKit-Surgery
                   libraries can be rapidly assembled into testable
                   clinical applications and subsequently translated to
                   production software without the need for software
                   reimplementation. The aim is to support translation
                   from single surgeon trials to multicentre trials in
                   under 2 years. METHODS: At the time of publication,
                   there were 13 SciKit-Surgery libraries provide
                   functionality for visualisation and augmented reality
                   in surgery, together with hardware interfaces for
                   video, tracking, and ultrasound sources. The
                   libraries are stand-alone, open source, and provide
                   Python interfaces. This design approach enables fast
                   development of robust applications and subsequent
                   translation. The paper compares the libraries with
                   existing platforms and uses two example applications
                   to show how SciKit-Surgery libraries can be used in
                   practice. RESULTS: Using the number of lines of code
                   and the occurrence of cross-dependencies as proxy
                   measurements of code complexity, two example
                   applications using SciKit-Surgery libraries are
                   analysed. The SciKit-Surgery libraries demonstrate
                   ability to support rapid development of testable
                   clinical applications. By maintaining stricter
                   orthogonality between libraries, the number, and
                   complexity of dependencies can be reduced. The
                   SciKit-Surgery libraries also demonstrate the
                   potential to support wider dissemination of novel
                   research. CONCLUSION: The SciKit-Surgery libraries
                   utilise the modularity of the Python language and the
                   standard data types of the NumPy package to provide
                   an easy-to-use, well-tested, and extensible set of
                   tools for the development of applications for
                   image-guided interventions. The example application
                   built on SciKit-Surgery has a simpler dependency
                   structure than the same application built using a
                   monolithic platform, making ongoing clinical
                   translation more feasible.},

  abstract =      {INTRODUCTION: The rapid pace of research in the field
                   of Artificial Intelligence in medicine has associated
                   risks for near-term AI. Ethical considerations of the
                   use of AI in medicine remain a subject of much
                   debate. Concurrently, the Involvement of People
                   living with disease and the Public (PPI) in research
                   is becoming mandatory in the EU and UK. The goal of
                   this research was to elucidate the important values
                   for our relevant stakeholders: People with MS,
                   Radiologists, neurologists, Registered Healthcare
                   Practitioners and Computer Scientists concerning AI
                   in radiology and synthesize these in an ethical
                   matrix. METHODS: An ethical matrix workshop
                   co-designed with a patient expert. The workshop
                   yielded a survey which was disseminated to the
                   professional societies of the relevant stakeholders.
                   Quantitative data were analysed using the Pingouin
                   0.53 python package. Qualitative data were examined
                   with word frequency analysis and analysed for themes
                   with grounded theory with a patient expert. RESULTS:
                   184 participants were recruited, (54, 60, 17, 12, 41
                   respectively). There were significant
                   (p~{$<~$}0.00001) differences in age, gender and
                   ethnicity between groups. Key themes emerging from
                   our results were the importance fast and accurate
                   results, explanations over model performance and the
                   significance of maintaining personal connections and
                   choice. These themes were used to construct the
                   ethical matrix. CONCLUSION: The ethical matrix is a
                   useful tool for PPI and stakeholder engagement with
                   particular advantages for near-term AI in the
                   pandemic era. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: We have
                   produced an ethical matrix that allows for the
                   inclusion of stakeholder opinion in medical AI
                   research design.},

  abstract =      {Multiple myeloma involves early dissemination of
                   malignant plasma cells across the bone marrow;
                   however, the initial steps of dissemination remain
                   unclear. Human bone marrow--derived mesenchymal
                   stromal cells (hMSC) stimulate myeloma cell expansion
                   (e.g., IL6) and simultaneously retain myeloma cells
                   via chemokines (e.g., CXCL12) and adhesion factors.
                   Hence, we hypothesized that the imbalance between
                   cell division and retention drives dissemination. We
                   present an in vitro model using primary hMSCs
                   cocultured with INA-6 myeloma cells. Time-lapse
                   microscopy revealed proliferation and
                   attachment/detachment dynamics. Separation techniques
                   (V-well adhesion assay and well plate sandwich
                   centrifugation) were established to isolate
                   MSC-interacting myeloma subpopulations that were
                   characterized by RNA sequencing, cell viability, and
                   apoptosis. Results were correlated with gene
                   expression data (n = 837) and survival of patients
                   with myeloma (n = 536). On dispersed hMSCs, INA-6
                   saturate hMSC surface before proliferating into large
                   homotypic aggregates, from which single cells
                   detached completely. On confluent hMSCs, aggregates
                   were replaced by strong heterotypic hMSC--INA-6
                   interactions, which modulated apoptosis time
                   dependently. Only INA-6 daughter cells (nMA-INA6)
                   detached from hMSCs by cell division but sustained
                   adherence to hMSC-adhering mother cells (MA-INA6).
                   Isolated nMA-INA6 indicated hMSC autonomy through
                   superior viability after IL6 withdrawal and
                   upregulation of proliferation-related genes. MA-INA6
                   upregulated adhesion and retention factors (CXCL12),
                   that, intriguingly, were highly expressed in myeloma
                   samples from patients with longer overall and
                   progression-free survival, but their expression
                   decreased in relapsed myeloma samples. Altogether, in
                   vitro dissemination of INA-6 is driven by detaching
                   daughter cells after a cycle of hMSC-(re)attachment
                   and proliferation, involving adhesion factors that
                   represent a bone marrow--retentive phenotype with
                   potential clinical relevance.},

                   and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/gp130/STAT3)
                   pathway has been reported to play an important role
                   in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) and for
                   survival of MM cells. However, most data concerning
                   the role of IL-6 and IL-6-triggered signaling
                   pathways were obtained from experiments performed
                   with MM cell lines and without considering the bone
                   marrow microenvironment. Thus, the precise role of
                   IL-6 and its intracellular signaling pathways for
                   survival of human MM cells is still unclear. Here we
                   show that treatment of human MM cells (IL-6-dependent
                   MM cell line INA-6 and primary MM cells) with the
                   IL-6 receptor antagonist Sant7 or with an anti-gp130
                   monoclonal antibody (mAb) induced apoptosis if the
                   cells were cultured in the absence of bone marrow
                   stromal cells (BMSCs). In contrast, apoptosis could
                   not be observed if the MM cells were cocultured with
                   BMSCs. The analysis of intracellular pathways
                   revealed that Sant7 and anti-gp130 mAb were
                   effectively inhibiting the phosphorylation of gp130
                   and STAT3 in the absence and presence of BMSCs,
                   whereas ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1,2) phosphorylation was
                   only slightly affected. In contrast, treatment with
                   the farnesyl transferase inhibitor, FPT III, induced
                   apoptosis in MM cells in the absence or presence of
                   BMSCs and led to a complete inhibition of the
                   Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These
                   observations indicate that the IL-6/gp130/STAT3
                   pathway is not essential for survival of human
                   myeloma cells if they are grown in the presence of
                   cells from the bone marrow microenvironment.
                   Furthermore, we provide evidence that farnesyl
                   transferase inhibitors might be useful for the
                   development of novel therapeutic strategies for the
                   treatment of MM.},

                   inevitable drug resistance. MM cells interacting with
                   bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) undergo substantial
                   changes in the transcriptome and develop de novo
                   multi-drug resistance. As a critical component in
                   transcriptional regulation, how the chromatin
                   landscape is transformed in MM cells exposed to BMSCs
                   and contributes to the transcriptional response to
                   BMSCs remains elusive. We profiled the transcriptome
                   and regulome for MM cells using a transwell coculture
                   system with BMSCs. The transcriptome and regulome of
                   MM cells from the upper transwell resembled MM cells
                   that coexisted with BMSCs from the lower chamber but
                   were distinctive to monoculture. BMSC-induced genes
                   were enriched in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway,
                   unfolded protein stress, signatures of early plasma
                   cells, and response to proteasome inhibitors. Genes
                   with increasing accessibility at multiple regulatory
                   sites were preferentially induced by BMSCs; these
                   genes were enriched in functions linked to responses
                   to drugs and unfavorable clinic outcomes. We proposed

                   antigen CD38, e.g., isatuximab, daratumumab, or
                   Mor202, have entered the therapeutic armamentarium in
                   multiple myeloma due to single agent overall response
                   rates of 29 vs. 36 vs. 31\%, effectivity in
                   combination regimen, e.g., with lenalidomide or
                   bortezomib plus dexamethasone, and tolerable side
                   effects. Despite clinical use, many questions remain.
                   In this manuscript, we address three of these: first,
                   upfront CD38 target-expression in AL-amyloidosis,
                   monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS),
                   asymptomatic, symptomatic, and relapsed multiple
                   myeloma. Second, relation of CD38-expression to
                   survival, disease stages, molecular entities, and
                   high-risk definitions. Third, alternative splicing or
                   lack of CD38-expression as potential mechanisms of
                   upfront resistance. We assessed CD138-purified plasma
                   cell samples from 196 AL-amyloidosis, 62 MGUS, 259
                   asymptomatic, 764 symptomatic, and 90 relapsed
                   myeloma patients, including longitudinal pairs of
                   asymptomatic/symptomatic (n\,=\,34) and
                   symptomatic/relapsed myeloma (n\,=\,57) regarding
                   interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization
                   (n\,=\,1,380), CD38-expression by gene expression
                   profiling (n\,=\,1,371), RNA-sequencing (n\,=\,593),
                   and flow cytometry (n\,=\,800). Samples of normal
                   bone marrow plasma cells (n\,=\,10), memory B-cells
                   (n\,=\,9), polyclonal plasmablastic cells (n\,=\,9),
                   and human myeloma cell lines (n\,=\,54) were used as
                   comparators. CD38 was expressed in all malignant
                   plasma cell samples, but significantly lower compared
                   to normal plasma cells with small but significant
                   downregulation in longitudinal sample pairs. Higher
                   CD38 expression was associated with the presence of
                   t(4;14) and high-risk according to the UAMS70-gene
                   score, lower expression was associated with del17p13
                   and hyperdiploidy in symptomatic myeloma as well as
                   t(11;14) in asymptomatic myeloma. Higher
                   CD38-expression was associated with slower
                   progression to symptomatic and relapsed myeloma and
                   better overall survival in the latter two entities.
                   CD38 expression, t(4;14), del17p13, and gain of 1q21
                   are independently prognostic in multivariate
                   analysis. By contrast, high CD38-expression is
                   associated with adverse survival in AL-amyloidosis.
                   Regarding mechanisms of upfront anti-CD38-treatment
                   resistance, lack of CD38-expression and alternative
                   splicing of receptor binding-sites could be excluded.

  abstract =      {Introduction: Cytokines of the gp130-family,
                   particularly interleukin(IL)-6, play a crucial role
                   in the propagation of malignant plasma cells.
                   Materials and methods: The role of IL-6 and other
                   gp130-cytokines was studied in the human plasma cell
                   line INA-6 in vitro and in INA-6 xenografts. The
                   proliferative response to gp130-cytokines was
                   evaluated and activated components of gp130-signaling
                   pathways were identified by Western blotting and DNA
                   binding studies. Specifically, expression of IL-6 and
                   receptors for IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor
                   were analysed by RT-PCR and ELISA. Results: The
                   plasma cell line INA-6 was cultured for several years
                   remaining strictly dependent on exogenous IL-6. Other
                   gp130-cytokines had no significant e{\"A}ect on INA-6
                   cell proliferation in vitro. Due to an activating
                   mutation in the N-ras gene, mitogen-activated protein
                   kinases (MAPK) were constitutively phosphorylated. In
                   contrast, signal transducer and activator of
                   transcription(STAT)-3 activation was dependent on
                   stimulation with IL-6. Blocking of either one of
                   these pathways resulted in a significant decrease of
                   INA-6 cell proliferation. Remarkably, INA-6
                   xenografts did not require exogeneous IL-6 for
                   proliferation in vivo. Instead, an autocrine IL-6
                   loop and, in certain tumor sublines, responsiveness
                   to additional gp130-cytokines was induced during in
                   vivo growth. Conclusion: Activation of the gp130
                   signal transducer is mandatory for INA-6 cell growth
                   in vitro and in vivo. Both the MAPK and the Jak/STAT
                   pathway are operative in malignant plasma cells and
                   either one is essential for plasma cell growth. The
                   INA-6 cell line provides a preclinical model to study
                   growth regulation of human plasmacytoma cells and to
                   evaluate novel therapeutic strategies. The Hematology

                   with malignant plasma cell diseases. Both cell lines
                   are EBNA negative and show morphological and
                   immunophenotypical features of plasma cells. INA-6
                   expresses the CD39 and CDw75 antigens, JK-6 is
                   strongty positive with CD38 and CD39 antibodies. By
                   flow cytometry they were non-reactive with Ia
                   antibodies and B ceil reagents CD19, CD20, CD21,
                   CD22, and CD24. While INA-6 cells are releasing kappa
                   light chains only, JK-6 cells produce IgG kappa. Both
                   cell lines could only be initiated with IL-6
                   supplemented medium and remained IL-6 responsive
                   throughout continuous culture. INA-6 is strictly
                   dependent on IL-6. No spontaneously secreted IL-6 was
                   found nor could it be induced by IL-1beta /TNFalpha
                   stimulation. Molecular analysis with RT-PCR revealed
                   mRNA for the IL-6 receptor in both lines. No IL-6
                   mRNA was detectable in INA-6 cells, while in JK-6
                   minute amounts were observed. Cytogenetic analysis of
                   both lines revealed, among other abnormalities, a
                   deletion (7)(p13). lnterestingly, the 7p deletion
                   affects the location ot the IL-6 gene. ln both cell
                   lines, IL-6 dependent proliferation could be
                   inhibited by IFNalpha. IFNalpha had growth regulatory
                   effects only on JK-6: while high concentrations were
                   inhibitory, low IFNalpha amounts were clearly
                   stimulatory. A wide variety of other cytokines
                   including GM-CSF and IL-11 did not have the capacity
                   to influence proliferation. These plasma cell lines

                   deviates from standard workflows, custom scripts are
                   needed. RESULTS: We present HTSeq, a Python library
                   to facilitate the rapid development of such scripts.
                   HTSeq offers parsers for many common data formats in
                   HTS projects, as well as classes to represent data,
                   such as genomic coordinates, sequences, sequencing
                   reads, alignments, gene model information and variant
                   calls, and provides data structures that allow for
                   querying via genomic coordinates. We also present
                   htseq-count, a tool developed with HTSeq that
                   preprocesses RNA-Seq data for differential expression
                   analysis by counting the overlap of reads with genes.

                   of raw data are thus transformed into knowledge,
                   which is made available via a multitude of channels,
                   in particular our browser (http://www.ensembl.org).
                   Over time, we have expanded in multiple directions.
                   First, our resources describe multiple fields of
                   genomics, in particular gene annotation, comparative
                   genomics, genetics and epigenomics. Second, we cover
                   a growing number of genome assemblies; Ensembl
                   Release 90 contains exactly 100. Third, our databases
                   feed simultaneously into an array of services
                   designed around different use cases, ranging from
                   quick browsing to genome-wide bioinformatic analysis.
                   We present here the latest developments of the
                   Ensembl project, with a focus on managing an
                   increasing number of assemblies, supporting efforts
                   in genome interpretation and improving our browser.},

                   (homotypic cell aggregations). In order to clarify
                   the surface molecules involved in homotypic cell
                   aggregations and physiological roles of these cell
                   aggregations, we investigated the expressions of
                   intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and
                   lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) on
                   20 samples of freshly isolated myeloma cells and
                   three myeloma cell lines and the effect of
                   anti-ICAM-1 and anti-LFA-1{$\alpha$} antibodies on
                   myeloma cell proliferation in vitro. All myeloma
                   cells that we tested expressed ICAM-1 on their
                   surface. Among them, myeloma cells that strongly
                   coexpressed LFA-1{$\alpha$}, formed homotypic cell
                   aggregates in vitro. These spontaneous cell
                   aggregations were completely released by adding
                   either anti-ICAM-1 or anti-LFA-1{$\alpha$} antibody.
                   During short-term culture, spontaneous proliferation
                   of myeloma cells in vitro and their proliferative
                   responses to recombinant interleukin-6 (rIL-6) were

                   anti-ICAM-1 or anti-LFA-1{$\alpha$} antibody.
                   Therefore these data suggest that homotypic cell
                   aggregation of myeloma cells is mediated by ICAM-1
                   and LFA-1 molecules, but myeloma cell proliferation
                   may not be modulated by these adhesion molecules

                   liquid suspension or methylcellulose semi-solid
                   culture, both in the presence of interleukin-6
                   (IL-6). The survival or growth of myeloma cells in
                   liquid culture was classified into four categories.
                   Type 1: myeloma cells survived for only 2-3 weeks in
                   eight patients; Type 2: survival for 1-2 months in
                   seven patients; Type 3: survival for more than 3
                   months without an obvious increase in cell number in
                   three patients; and Type 4: continuous proliferation
                   (cell line) in three patients. As the clinical stage
                   advanced, the survival of myeloma cells became
                   longer. All three myeloma cell lines were obtained
                   from patients in an advanced clinical stage. Human
                   plasma added to the liquid culture induced the
                   survival or growth of myeloma cells better than fetal
                   calf serum in any survival or growth type. Myeloma
                   colonies or clusters were generated in seven of 21
                   patients, though myeloma colony formation was
                   restricted to Type 4 patients. IL-6 neither prolonged
                   the survival of myeloma cells nor promoted their
                   growth in vitro except for Type 4 cells. Moreover,
                   IL-6 did not increase the success rate of generating
                   myeloma colonies in vitro. However, IL-6 did elevate
                   the number of myeloma clusters in Types 1, 2 and 3
                   patients examined. These results suggest that IL-6
                   has a minor proliferative effect on myeloma cells in
                   semi-solid culture but not in liquid suspension

                   stromal cells and adhesion to extracellular matrix
                   proteins. , Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is
                   an aggressive disease with a high proliferation rate.
                   However, the molecular and genetic features that
                   drive the aggressive clinical behavior of DLBCL are
                   not fully defined. Here, we have demonstrated that
                   activated Jun signaling is a frequent event in DLBCL
                   that promotes dissemination of malignant cells.
                   Downregulation of Jun dramatically reduces lymphoma

  abstract =      {Recent studies have underscored the role of
                   B-cell-activating factor (BAFF), a member of the
                   tumor necrosis factor superfamily, in promoting the
                   survival of malignant B cells, including human
                   multiple myeloma. We here characterized the
                   functional significance of BAFF in the interaction
                   between multiple myeloma and bone marrow stromal
                   cells (BMSC) and further defined the molecular
                   mechanisms regulating these processes. BAFF is
                   detected on BMSCs derived from multiple myeloma
                   patients as evidenced by flow cytometry. BAFF
                   secretion is 3- to 10-fold higher in BMSCs than in
                   multiple myeloma cells, and tumor cell adhesion to
                   BMSCs augments BAFF secretion by 2- to 5-fold,
                   confirmed by both ELISA and immunoblotting. Adhesion
                   of MM1S and MCCAR multiple myeloma cell lines to
                   KM104 BMSC line transfected with a luciferase
                   reporter vector carrying the BAFF gene promoter
                   (BAFF-LUC) significantly enhanced luciferase
                   activity, suggesting that nuclear factor-kappaB
                   (NF-kappaB) activation induced by multiple myeloma
                   adhesion to BMSCs mediates BAFF up-regulation.
                   Moreover, BAFF (0-100 ng/mL) increases adhesion of
                   multiple myeloma lines to BMSCs in a dose-dependent
                   manner; conversely, transmembrane activator and
                   calcium modulator and cyclophylin ligand
                   interactor-Ig or B-cell maturation antigen/Fc blocked
                   BAFF stimulation. Using adenoviruses expressing
                   dominant-negative and constitutively expressed AKT as
                   well as NF-kappaB inhibitors, we further showed that
                   BAFF-induced multiple myeloma cell adhesion is
                   primarily mediated via activation of AKT and
                   NF-kappaB signaling. Importantly, BAFF similarly
                   increased adhesion of CD138-expressing patient
                   multiple myeloma cells to BMSCs. These studies
                   establish a role for BAFF in localization and
                   survival of multiple myeloma cells in the bone marrow
                   microenvironment and strongly support novel
                   therapeutics, targeting the interaction between BAFF

                   of the disease and is usually associated with severe
                   morbidity. The balance between receptor activator of
                   nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) ligand and
                   osteoprotegerin (OPG) is of major importance in bone
                   homeostasis. We have recently shown that serum OPG
                   levels are lower in patients with myeloma than in
                   healthy individuals. Here we show that myeloma cells
                   can bind, internalize, and degrade OPG, thereby
                   providing a possible explanation for the lower levels
                   of OPG in the BM of patients with MM. This process is
                   dependent on interaction of OPG with heparan sulfates
                   on the myeloma cells. The results suggest a novel
                   biologic mechanism for the bone disease associated
                   with MM and that treatment of the bone disease with
                   OPG lacking the heparin-binding domain should be

                   role in cell growth, invasion, angiogenesis,
                   metastasis, and bone degradation, all important
                   events in the pathogenesis of cancer. Multiple
                   myeloma is a B-cell cancer characterized by the
                   proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone
                   marrow, increased angiogenesis, and the development
                   of osteolytic bone disease. The role of MMPs in the
                   development of multiple myeloma is poorly understood.
                   Using SC-964, a potent inhibitor of several MMPs
                   (MMP-2, -3, -8, -9, and -13), we investigated the
                   role of MMPs in the 5T2MM murine model. Reverse
                   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated
                   the presence of mRNA for MMP-2, -8, -9, and -13 in
                   5T2MM-diseased bone marrow. Mice bearing 5T2MM cells
                   were given access to food containing SC-964. The
                   concentration of SC-964 measured in the plasma of
                   mice after 11 days of treatment was able to inhibit
                   MMP-9 activity in gelatin zymography. Treatment of
                   5T2MM-bearing mice resulted in a significant
                   reduction in tumor burden, a significant decrease in
                   angiogenesis, and partially protective effect against
                   the development of osteolytic bone disease. The
                   direct role of MMPs in these different processes was
                   confirmed by in vitro experiments. All these results
                   support the multifunctional role of MMPs in the
                   development of multiple myeloma.},

                   TG2) is the most ubiquitously expressed member of the
                   transglutaminase family (EC 2.3.2.13) that catalyzes
                   specific post-translational modifications of proteins
                   through a calcium-dependent acyl-transfer reaction
                   (transamidation). In addition, this enzyme displays
                   multiple additional enzymatic activities, such as
                   guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, protein
                   kinase, disulfide isomerase activities, and is
                   involved in cell adhesion. Transglutaminase 2 has
                   been reported as one of key enzymes that is involved
                   in all stages of carcinogenesis; the molecular
                   mechanisms of action and physiopathological effects
                   depend on its expression or activities, cellular
                   localization, and specific cancer model. Since it has
                   been reported as both a potential tumor suppressor
                   and a tumor-promoting factor, the role of this enzyme
                   in cancer is still controversial. Indeed, TG2
                   overexpression has been frequently associated with
                   cancer stem cells' survival, inflammation, metastatic
                   spread, and drug resistance. On the other hand, the
                   use of inducers of TG2 transamidating activity seems
                   to inhibit tumor cell plasticity and invasion. This
                   review covers the extensive and rapidly growing field
                   of the role of TG2 in cancer stem cells survival and
                   epithelial--mesenchymal transition, apoptosis and

                   in multiple myeloma (MM) by attracting and activating
                   plasma cells in the bone marrow. CXCR4 expression in
                   MM cells is inversely correlated with disease
                   activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate CXCR4
                   as a prognostic tool in MM, as well as other markers
                   of disease, such as chromosomal aberrancies. Purpose
                   was to investigate the expression levels of
                   SDF-1{$\alpha$} before and after bortezomib and
                   thalidomide treatment. From February 2006 to April
                   2012, CXCR4 expression was prospectively assessed in
                   bone marrow samples from a large population of
                   patients (n=227) using flow cytometry. Clinical
                   characteristics were collected and chromosomal
                   aberrancies were assessed in 144 patients.
                   SDF-1{$\alpha$} levels were determined using ELISA in
                   peripheral blood samples from 40 patients before and
                   after chemotherapy. Our results show that CXCR4 was
                   present in 43.2\% (98/227) of newly diagnosed MM
                   patients and that CXCR4 expression was significantly
                   correlated with CD117 (P{$<$}0.05). CXCR4-positive MM
                   patients had a significantly longer estimated
                   survival time than CXCR4-negative patients (median of
                   48 vs. 42 months, P{$<$}0.05). Multivariate survival
                   analyses identified that the +1q21/CXCR4- phenotype
                   is an independent survival predictor, along with the
                   International Staging System (ISS) stage. No
                   significant difference was observed in expression
                   levels of SDF-1{$\alpha$} before and after
                   bortezomib/thalidomide treatment. In conclusion,
                   +1q21/CXCR4- could be an independent survival
                   prognosis predictor in MM patients. Expression levels
                   of SDF-1{$\alpha$} before and after
                   bortezomib/thalidomide treatment are not different,
                   although they are higher than in controls.},

                   to model the disease. However, a long-standing
                   question is how well these cell lines truly represent
                   tumor cells in patients. Here, we employ a recently
                   described method of transcriptional correlation
                   profiling to compare similarity of 66 MM cell lines
                   to 779 newly diagnosed MM patient tumors. We found
                   that individual MM lines differ significantly with
                   respect to patient tumor representation, with median
                   R ranging from 0.35 to 0.54. ANBL-6 was the "best"
                   line, markedly exceeding all others
                   (p\,{$<$}\,2.2e-16). Notably, some widely used cell
                   lines (RPMI-8226, U-266) scored poorly in our patient
                   similarity ranking (48 and 52 of 66, respectively).
                   Lines cultured with interleukin-6 showed
                   significantly improved correlations with patient
                   tumor (p\,=\,9.5e-4). When common MM genomic features
                   were matched between cell lines and patients, only
                   t(4;14) and t(14;16) led to increased transcriptional
                   correlation. To demonstrate the utility of our
                   top-ranked line for preclinical studies, we showed
                   that intravenously implanted ANBL-6 proliferates in
                   hematopoietic organs in immunocompromised mice.
                   Overall, our large-scale quantitative correlation
                   analysis, utilizing emerging datasets, provides a
                   resource informing the MM community of cell lines
                   that may be most reliable for modeling patient
                   disease while also elucidating biological differences

                   contrast to activation of p53, which is associated
                   with the induction of apoptosis, stimulation of
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B has been shown to promote resistance
                   to programmed cell death. These observations suggest
                   that a regulatory mechanism must exist to integrate
                   these opposing outcomes and coordinate this critical
                   cellular decision-making event. Here we show that
                   both p53 and NF-{$\kappa$}B inhibit each other's
                   ability to stimulate gene expression and that this
                   process is controlled by the relative levels of each
                   transcription factor. Expression of either wild-type
                   p53 or the RelA(p65) NF-{$\kappa$}B subunit
                   suppresses stimulation of transcription by the other
                   factor from a reporter plasmid in vivo. Moreover,
                   endogenous, tumor necrosis factor alpha-activated
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B will inhibit endogenous wild-type p53
                   transactivation. Following exposure to UV light,
                   however, the converse is observed, with p53
                   downregulating NF-{$\kappa$}B-mediated
                   transcriptional activation. Both p53 and RelA(p65)
                   interact with the transcriptional coactivator
                   proteins p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), and we

                   competition for a limiting pool of p300/CBP complexes

                   mechanisms that govern cellular processes such as
                   apoptosis. Furthermore, they suggest a previously

                   vital cellular decisions.The abundance and activity
                   of both p53 and E2f are often controlled by the same

                   often present in human tumours, constitutes an
                   oncogenic stress that activates p53. Specifically,
                   E2f indirectly affects the level and activity of p53
                   by upregulating the expression of many proteins that

                   is a strong adverse prognostic factor in multiple
                   myeloma and simultaneously targetable by available
                   (e.g. tubulin polymerase inhibitors) and upcoming
                   (e.g. aurora kinase inhibitors) compounds. DESIGN AND
                   METHODS: We assessed proliferation using gene
                   expression-based indices in 757 samples including
                   independent cohorts of 298 and 345 samples of
                   CD138-purified myeloma cells from previously
                   untreated patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy,
                   together with clinical prognostic factors,
                   chromosomal aberrations, and gene expression-based
                   high-risk scores. RESULTS: In the two cohorts, 43.3\%
                   and 39.4\% of the myeloma cell samples showed a
                   proliferation index above the median plus three
                   standard deviations of normal bone marrow plasma
                   cells. Malignant plasma cells of patients in advanced
                   stages or those harboring disease
                   progression-associated gain of 1q21 or deletion of
                   13q14.3 showed significantly higher proliferation
                   indices; patients with gain of chromosome 9, 15 or 19
                   (hyperdiploid samples) had significantly lower
                   proliferation indices. Proliferation correlated with
                   the presence of chromosomal aberrations in metaphase
                   cytogenetics. It was significantly predictive for
                   event-free and overall survival in both cohorts,
                   allowed highly predictive risk stratification (e.g.
                   event-free survival 12.7 versus 26.2 versus 40.6
                   months, P {$<$} 0.001) of patients, and was largely
                   independent of clinical prognostic factors, e.g.
                   serum {$\beta_2$}-microglobulin, International
                   Staging System stage, associated high-risk
                   chromosomal aberrations, e.g. translocation t(4;14),
                   and gene expression-based high-risk scores.
                   CONCLUSIONS: Proliferation assessed by gene
                   expression profiling, being independent of
                   serum-{$\beta_2$}-microglobulin, International
                   Staging System stage, t(4;14), and gene
                   expression-based risk scores, is a central prognostic
                   factor in multiple myeloma. Surrogating a biological
                   targetable variable, gene expression-based assessment
                   of proliferation allows selection of patients for
                   risk-adapted anti-proliferative treatment on the
                   background of conventional and gene expression-based
                   risk factors.},

                   correlated to increased intravasation, the details of
                   transendothelial migration and detachment into
                   circulation are still unclear. Here we analyzed the
                   intravasation of invasive human breast cancer cells
                   within a tissue-engineered microvessel model of the
                   tumor microenvironment. Using live-cell fluorescence
                   microscopy, we captured 2,330 hours of tumor cell
                   interactions with functional microvessels and provide
                   evidence for a mitosis-mediated mechanism where tumor
                   cells located along the vessel periphery are able to
                   disrupt the vessel endothelium through cell division
                   and detach into circulation. This model provides a
                   framework for understanding the physical and
                   biological parameters of the tumor microenvironment
                   that mediate intravasation of tumor cells across an

                   (PDF) files is simple, and can be accomplished

                   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
                   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched Google
                   Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline to
                   identify studies published between 2022 and 2023 that
                   aimed to utilize ChatGPT in medical research. All
                   identified references were stored in EndNote. Results
                   We initially identified 114 articles, out of which
                   six studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria
                   for full-text screening. Among the six studies, two
                   focused on drug development (33.33\%), two on
                   literature review writing (33.33\%), and one each on

                   perspectives on its utility to systematic reviews
                   (SRs) through the appropriateness and applicability
                   of its responses to SR related prompts. The
                   advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted
                   technologies leave many wondering about the current
                   capabilities, limitations, and opportunities for
                   integration AI into scientific endeavors. Large
                   language models (LLM)---such as ChatGPT, designed by
                   OpenAI---have recently gained widespread attention
                   with their ability to respond to various prompts in a
                   natural-sounding way. Systematic reviews (SRs)
                   utilize secondary data and often require many months
                   and substantial financial resources to complete,
                   making them attractive grounds for developing
                   AI-assistive technologies. On February 6, 2023, PICO
                   Portal developers hosted a webinar to explore
                   ChatGPT's responses to tasks related to SR
                   methodology. Our experience from exploring the
                   responses of ChatGPT suggest that while ChatGPT and
                   LLMs show some promise for aiding in SR-related
                   tasks, the technology is in its infancy and needs
                   much development for such applications. Furthermore,
                   we advise that great caution should be taken by
                   non-content experts in using these tools due to much
                   of the output appearing, at a high level, to be
                   valid, while much is erroneous and in need of active
                   vetting.},

                   significant promise for assisting users with complex
                   tasks, thereby boosting human productivity. Existing
                   works leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) or
                   LLM-based AI agents have shown capabilities in
                   automating tasks on Android and Web platforms.
                   However, these tasks are primarily aimed at simple
                   device usage and entertainment operations. This paper
                   presents a novel benchmark, AssistGUI, to evaluate
                   whether models are capable of manipulating the mouse
                   and keyboard on the Windows platform in response to
                   user-requested tasks. We carefully collected a set of
                   100 tasks from nine widely-used software
                   applications, such as, After Effects and MS Word,
                   each accompanied by the necessary project files for
                   better evaluation. Moreover, we propose an advanced
                   Actor-Critic Embodied Agent framework, which
                   incorporates a sophisticated GUI parser driven by an
                   LLM-agent and an enhanced reasoning mechanism adept
                   at handling lengthy procedural tasks. Our
                   experimental results reveal that our GUI Parser and
                   Reasoning mechanism outshine existing methods in
                   performance. Nevertheless, the potential remains
                   substantial, with the best model attaining only a
                   46\% success rate on our benchmark. We conclude with
                   a thorough analysis of the current methods'
                   limitations, setting the stage for future
                   breakthroughs in this domain.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Content generated by artificial
                   intelligence is sometimes not truthful. To date,
                   there have been a number of medical studies related
                   to the validity of ChatGPT's responses; however,
                   there is a lack of studies addressing various aspects
                   of statistical analysis. The aim of this study was to
                   assess the validity of the answers provided by
                   ChatGPT in relation to statistical analysis, as well
                   as to identify recommendations to be implemented in
                   the future in connection with the results obtained.
                   METHODS: The study was divided into four parts and
                   was based on the exemplary medical field of
                   allergology. The first part consisted of asking
                   ChatGPT 30 different questions related to statistical
                   analysis. The next five questions included a request
                   for ChatGPT to perform the relevant statistical
                   analyses, and another five requested ChatGPT to
                   indicate which statistical test should be applied to
                   articles accepted for publication in Allergy. The
                   final part of the survey involved asking ChatGPT the
                   same statistical question three times. RESULTS: Out
                   of the 40 general questions asked that related to
                   broad statistical analysis, ChatGPT did not fully
                   answer half of them. Assumptions necessary for the
                   application of specific statistical tests were not
                   included. ChatGPT also gave completely divergent
                   answers to one question about which test should be
                   used. CONCLUSION: The answers provided by ChatGPT to
                   various statistical questions may give rise to the
                   use of inappropriate statistical tests and,
                   consequently, the subsequent misinterpretation of the
                   research results obtained. Questions asked in this
                   regard need to be framed more precisely.},

                   method to study angiogenesis, particularly in the
                   retina, remains a problem. Angiogenesis can be
                   assessed through in vitro and in vivo studies. In
                   spite of inherent limitations, in vitro studies are
                   faster, easier to perform and quantify, and typically
                   less expensive and allow the study of isolated
                   angiogenesis steps. We performed a systematic review
                   of PubMed searching for original articles that
                   applied in vitro or ex vivo angiogenic retinal assays
                   until May 2017, presenting the available assays and
                   discussing their applicability, advantages, and
                   disadvantages. Most of the studies evaluated
                   migration, proliferation, and tube formation of
                   endothelial cells in response to inhibitory or
                   stimulatory compounds. Other aspects of angiogenesis
                   were studied by assessing cell permeability,
                   adhesion, or apoptosis, as well as by implementing
                   organotypic models of the retina. Emphasis is placed
                   on how the methods are applied and how they can
                   contribute to retinal angiogenesis comprehension. We
                   also discuss how to choose the best cell culture to
                   implement these methods. When applied together, in
                   vitro and ex vivo studies constitute a powerful tool
                   to improve retinal angiogenesis knowledge. This
                   review provides support for researchers to better
                   select the most suitable protocols in this field.},

                   genetic instabilities, environmental signals,
                   cellular protein flows, and gene regulatory networks.
                   Understanding the cybernetics of cancer requires the
                   integration of information dynamics across
                   multidimensional spatiotemporal scales, including
                   genetic, transcriptional, metabolic, proteomic,
                   epigenetic, and multi-cellular networks. However, the
                   time-series analysis of these complex networks
                   remains vastly absent in cancer research. With
                   longitudinal screening and time-series analysis of
                   cellular dynamics, universally observed causal
                   patterns pertaining to dynamical systems, may

                   of these patterns, strange attractors, may be

                   emergence of intracellular chaos and chaotic cell
                   population dynamics remains a new paradigm in systems
                   medicine. As such, chaotic and complex dynamics are
                   discussed as mathematical hallmarks of cancer cell
                   fate dynamics herein. Given the assumption that

                   algorithms from complexity theory, are hereby
                   reviewed to investigate critical phenomena and
                   chaotic dynamics in cancer ecosystems. To conclude,
                   the perspective cultivates an intuition for

                   commonly used to visualize chromatin in live cells by
                   fluorescence microscopy. A caveat is that the probes
                   themselves should not perturb cellular responses and
                   under normal conditions the dyes are generally
                   non-toxic. However, researchers are increasingly
                   using computerized time-lapse microscopy (CTLM),
                   where cells stained with fluorescent dyes are often
                   imaged frequently over a period of several days, to
                   follow cellular responses in real time. Little is
                   currently known about possible toxicity of
                   fluorescent DNA dyes under CTLM conditions. In this
                   study we demonstrate that the common live-cell DNA
                   stain Hoechst 33342 can cause apoptosis under CTLM
                   conditions. Although toxicity is evident at long
                   times in the absence of imaging at high dye
                   concentrations, phototoxicity from repeated
                   excitation of the dye in the imaging process is
                   dominant. We show that phototoxicity is a function of
                   the product of light fluence and dye concentration,
                   irrespective of irradiance, frequency and total
                   number of scans. Thus, phototoxicity can be prevented
                   by a combination of dye concentration and imaging
                   procedure that is below this threshold. These
                   quantitative data can be used as a guide to others
                   performing time-lapse microscopy studies with this
                   common live-cell DNA stain and serves as a caution
                   for researchers when using other fluorescent stains
                   under CTLM conditions.},

  abstract =      {Motivation: Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is one
                   of the most widely used methods to measure gene
                   expression. Despite extensive research in qPCR
                   laboratory protocols, normalization and statistical
                   analysis, little attention has been given to qPCR
                   non-detects---those reactions failing to produce a
                   minimum amount of signal., Results: We show that the
                   common methods of handling qPCR non-detects lead to
                   biased inference. Furthermore, we show that
                   non-detects do not represent data missing completely
                   at random and likely represent missing data occurring
                   not at random. We propose a model of the missing data
                   mechanism and develop a method to directly model
                   non-detects as missing data. Finally, we show that
                   our approach results in a sizeable reduction in bias
                   when estimating both absolute and differential gene
                   expression., Availability and implementation: The
                   proposed algorithm is implemented in the R package,
                   nondetects. This package also contains the raw data
                   for the three example datasets used in this
                   manuscript. The package is freely available at

  abstract =      {Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is one of the most
                   widely used methods to measure gene expression. An
                   important aspect of qPCR data that has been largely
                   ignored is the presence of non-detects: reactions
                   failing to exceed the quantification threshold and
                   therefore lacking a measurement of expression. While
                   most current software replaces these non-detects with
                   a value representing the limit of detection, this
                   introduces substantial bias in the estimation of both
                   absolute and differential expression. Single
                   imputation procedures, while an improvement on
                   previously used methods, underestimate residual
                   variance, which can lead to anti-conservative
                   inference. We propose to treat non-detects as
                   non-random missing data, model the missing data
                   mechanism, and use this model to impute missing
                   values or obtain direct estimates of model
                   parameters. To account for the uncertainty inherent
                   in the imputation, we propose a multiple imputation
                   procedure, which provides a set of plausible values
                   for each non-detect. We assess the proposed methods
                   via simulation studies and demonstrate the
                   applicability of these methods to three experimental
                   data sets. We compare our methods to mean imputation,
                   single imputation, and a penalized EM algorithm
                   incorporating non-random missingness (PEMM). The
                   developed methods are implemented in the
                   R/Bioconductor package nondetects. The statistical
                   methods introduced here reduce discrepancies in gene
                   expression values derived from qPCR experiments in
                   the presence of non-detects, providing increased
                   confidence in downstream analyses.},

                   practice can be improved to maximize benefits more
                   quickly and with greater flexibility. To expedite
                   translation, researchers have developed innovative
                   approaches to implementation branded as "rapid" and
                   "agile" implementation. Rapid implementation has
                   roots in precision medicine and agile implementation
                   has roots in systems engineering and software design.
                   Research has shown that innovation often derives from
                   learning and applying ideas that have impacted other
                   fields. IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCHERS:
                   This commentary examines "rapid" and "agile"
                   approaches to implementation and provides
                   recommendations to implementation researchers
                   stemming from these approaches. Four key ideas are
                   synthesized that may be broadly applicable to
                   implementation research, including (1) adopting a
                   problem orientation, (2) applying lessons from
                   behavioral economics, (3) using adaptive study
                   designs and adaptive interventions, and (4) using
                   multi-level models to guide implementation. Examples
                   are highlighted from the field where researchers are
                   applying these key ideas to illustrate their
                   potential impact. CONCLUSIONS: "Rapid" and "agile"
                   implementation approaches to implementation stem from
                   diverse fields. Elements of these approaches show
                   potential for advancing implementation research,
                   although adopting them may entail shifting scientific
                   norms in the field.},

  abstract =      {In the analysis of quantitative PCR (qPCR) data, the
                   quantification cycle (Cq) indicates the position of
                   the amplification curve with respect to the cycle
                   axis. Because Cq is directly related to the starting
                   concentration of the target, and the difference in Cq
                   values is related to the starting concentration
                   ratio, the only results of qPCR analysis reported are
                   often Cq, {$\Delta$}Cq or {$\Delta\Delta$}Cq values.
                   However, reporting of Cq values ignores the fact that
                   Cq values may differ between runs and machines, and,
                   therefore, cannot be compared between laboratories.
                   Moreover, Cq values are highly dependent on the PCR
                   efficiency, which differs between assays and may
                   differ between samples. Interpreting reported Cq
                   values, assuming a 100\% efficient PCR, may lead to
                   assumed gene expression ratios that are 100-fold off.
                   This review describes how differences in
                   quantification threshold setting, PCR efficiency,
                   starting material, PCR artefacts, pipetting errors
                   and sampling variation are at the origin of
                   differences and variability in Cq values and
                   discusses the limits to the interpretation of
                   observed Cq values. These issues can be avoided by
                   calculating efficiency-corrected starting
                   concentrations per reaction. The reporting of gene
                   expression ratios and fold difference between
                   treatments can then easily be based on these starting
                   concentrations.},

                   molecular biology to study low abundance gene
                   expression. Real-time PCR is easy to perform,
                   provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable
                   as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate
                   quantification of nucleic acids requires a
                   reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical
                   model for data analysis. This study enters into the
                   particular topics of the relative quantification in
                   real-time RT--PCR of a target gene transcript in
                   comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore,
                   a new mathematical model is presented. The relative

                   chain reaction (PCR) by monitoring the product
                   formation with the fluorescent dye SYBR Green I is
                   being extensively used in neurosciences,
                   developmental biology, and medical diagnostics. Most
                   PCR data analysis procedures assume that the PCR
                   efficiency for the amplicon of interest is constant
                   or even, in the case of the comparative Ct method,
                   equal to 2. The latter method already leads to a
                   4-fold error when the PCR efficiencies vary over just
                   a 0.04 range. PCR efficiencies of amplicons are
                   usually calculated from standard curves based on
                   either known RNA inputs or on dilution series of a
                   reference cDNA sample. In this paper we show that the
                   first approach can lead to PCR efficiencies that vary
                   over a 0.2 range, whereas the second approach may be
                   off by 0.26. Therefore, we propose linear regression
                   on the Log(fluorescence) per cycle number data as an
                   assumption-free method to calculate starting
                   concentrations of mRNAs and PCR efficiencies for each
                   sample. A computer program to perform this
                   calculation is available on request (email:

                   samples based on the quantification cycle (Cq) value
                   observed in the amplification curves. Results of qPCR
                   experiments are regularly calculated as if all assays
                   are 100\% efficient or reported as just Cq,
                   {$\Delta$}Cq, or {$\Delta\Delta$}Cq values.When the
                   reaction shows specific amplification, it should be
                   deemed to be positive, regardless of the observed Cq.
                   Because the Cq is highly dependent on amplification
                   efficiency that can vary among targets and samples,
                   accurate calculation of the target quantity and
                   relative gene expression requires that the actual
                   amplification efficiency be taken into account in the
                   analysis and reports. PCR efficiency is frequently
                   derived from standard curves, but this approach is
                   affected by dilution errors and hampered by
                   properties of the standard and the diluent. These
                   factors affect accurate quantification of clinical
                   and biological samples used in diagnostic
                   applications and collected in challenging conditions.
                   PCR efficiencies determined from individual
                   amplification curves avoid these confounders. To
                   obtain unbiased efficiency-corrected results, we
                   recommend absolute quantification with a single
                   undiluted calibrator with a known target
                   concentration and efficiency values derived from the
                   amplification curves of the calibrator and the
                   unknown samples.For meaningful diagnostics or
                   biological interpretation, the reported results of
                   qPCR experiments should be efficiency corrected. To

                   procedures and consequences of exploratory
                   experimentation (EE). While all of these measurements
                   fulfill the requirements of EE: probing new parameter
                   spaces, being void of a target theory and applying a
                   broad range of experimental methods, we identify
                   epistemic differences and suggest a classification of
                   EE. We distinguish classes of EE according to their
                   respective goals: the exploration where an
                   established global theory cannot provide the details
                   of a local phenomenon, exploration of an astonishing
                   discovery and exploration to find a new entity. We
                   find that these classes also differ with respect to
                   the existence of an identifiable target and their
                   impact on the background theory. The characteristics
                   distinguish EE from other kinds of experimentation,
                   even though these different kinds have not yet been
                   systematically studied. The formal rigor and
                   precision of LHC physics facilitates to analyze
                   concept formation in its early state. In particular
                   we emphasize the importance for nil--results for
                   conceptualization and argue that conceptualization
                   can also be achieved from nil--results only.},

                   not changed our view of biology. The past 10 years
                   have seen an explosion of interest in imaging
                   cellular processes, down to the molecular level.
                   There are now many advanced techniques being applied
                   to live cell imaging. However, cellular health is
                   often under appreciated. For many researchers, if the
                   cell at the end of the experiment has not gone into
                   apoptosis or is blebbed beyond recognition, than all
                   is well. This is simply incorrect. There are many
                   factors that need to be considered when performing
                   live-cell imaging in order to maintain cellular
                   health such as: imaging modality, media, temperature,
                   humidity, PH, osmolality, and photon dose. The
                   wavelength of illuminating light, and the total
                   photon dose that the cells are exposed to, comprise
                   two of the most important and controllable parameters
                   of live-cell imaging. The lowest photon dose that
                   achieves a measureable metric for the experimental
                   question should be used, not the dose that produces
                   cover photo quality images. This is paramount to
                   ensure that the cellular processes being investigated
                   are in their in vitro state and not shifted to an
                   alternate pathway due to environmental stress. The
                   timing of the mitosis is an ideal canary in the gold
                   mine, in that any stress induced from the imaging
                   will result in the increased length of mitosis, thus
                   providing a control model for the current imagining
                   conditions.},

                   mechanisms to actively sample their environment. In

                   paper reading. The main objective was to assess the
                   current state of research comparing digital and paper
                   reading outcomes among students aged 6--18 years old,
                   as well as assessing the impact of various factors
                   (gender, socioeconomic status, and school location)
                   in explaining the differences between the two modes.
                   Inclusion criteria included the following:
                   participants (6--18 years), research focus (comparing
                   digital reading and paper reading), study type
                   (quantitative or mixed methods), publication (peer
                   reviewed between 2015 and 2022), and language
                   (English). A systematic search in four databases
                   (WOS, Scopus, ERIC, and JSTOR) in August 2022 was
                   conducted by three reviewers. The search revealed 23
                   studies matching the inclusion criteria. The findings
                   from the reviewed studies are diverse, with some
                   reporting no significant differences in reading
                   comprehension between the two modes, while others
                   suggest screen inferiority, thereby favoring paper
                   reading. Individual-level predictors, such as prior
                   comprehension skills and reading habits, play a
                   crucial role in determining reading performance
                   across modes. Family-level factors, such as the
                   number of books at home, and school-level factors,
                   like the usage of ICT resources, influence both paper
                   and digital reading comprehension. Moreover, gender
                   differences in attitudes and performance towards
                   different reading modes are apparent. SES is
                   positively associated with reading achievement in
                   both modes, with a larger effect shown for paper
                   reading. Overall, the comparison between electronic
                   and paper reading modes reveals a complex interplay
                   of individual and contextual factors influencing
                   reading comprehension and attitudes.},

                   material in biomedical journal articles from the
                   perspectives of authors, peer reviewers and readers.
                   Design and setting We conducted online surveys
                   (November--December 2016) of corresponding authors
                   and peer reviewers at 17 BMJ Publishing Group
                   journals in a range of specialities. Participants
                   Participants were asked to respond to one of three
                   surveys: as authors, peer reviewers or readers.
                   Results We received 2872/20340 (14\%) responses:
                   authors 819/6892 (12\%), peer reviewers 1142/6682
                   (17\%) and readers 911/6766 (14\%). Most authors
                   submitted (711/819, 87\%) and 80\% (724/911) of
                   readers reported reading supplementary material with
                   their last article, while 95\% (1086/1142) of
                   reviewers reported seeing these materials sometimes.
                   Additional data tables were the most common
                   supplementary material reported (authors: 74\%;
                   reviewers: 89\%; readers: 67\%). A majority in each
                   group indicated additional tables were most useful to
                   readers (61\%--77\%); 20\%--36\%\,and 3\%--4\%
                   indicated they were most useful to peer reviewers and
                   journal editors, respectively. Checklists and
                   reporting guidelines showed the opposite: higher
                   proportions of each group regarded these as most
                   useful to journal editors. All three groups favoured
                   the publication of additional tables and figures on
                   the journal's website (80\%--83\%), with {$<$}4\% of
                   each group responding that these do not need to be
                   available. Approximately one-fifth (16\%--23\%)
                   responded that raw study data should be available on
                   the journal's website, while 24\%--33\% said that
                   these materials should not be made available
                   anywhere. Conclusions Authors, peer reviewers and
                   readers agree that supplementary materials are
                   useful. Supplementary tables and figures were
                   favoured over reporting checklists or raw data for
                   reading but not for study replication. Journals

                   understand medical videos and provide visual answers
                   to natural language questions. We believe medical
                   videos may provide the best possible answers to many
                   first aid, medical emergency, and medical education
                   questions. Toward this, we created the MedVidCL and
                   MedVidQA datasets and introduce the tasks of Medical
                   Video Classification (MVC) and Medical Visual Answer
                   Localization (MVAL), two tasks that focus on
                   cross-modal (medical language and medical video)

                   the potential to support the development of
                   sophisticated downstream applications that can
                   benefit the public and medical practitioners. Our
                   datasets consist of 6,117 fine-grained annotated
                   videos for the MVC task and 3,010 questions and
                   answers timestamps from 899 videos for the MVAL task.
                   These datasets have been verified and corrected by
                   medical informatics experts. We have also benchmarked
                   each task with the created MedVidCL and MedVidQA

  abstract =      {The quantification of live and dead cells in a
                   substrate is often an essential step in cell biology
                   research. A staining protocol that acts differently
                   on live and on dead cells is applied and the number
                   of cells visible is counted using a microscope. Often
                   this counting is done manually or only evaluated
                   qualitatively. If the number of samples to be
                   analyzed is large, counting live and dead cells will
                   become a labor intensive, and in some cases an
                   unreliable, process. The manual procedure also
                   discards potentially relevant information on the
                   cells beyond their live or dead classification. For
                   example, cell size, shape and distribution cannot be
                   measured manually. Thus, developing a software
                   routine to replace the counting process can result in
                   an increase of both efficiency and quality of the
                   data gathering process. Whether or not the time
                   and/or money spent on creating a dedicated computer
                   algorithm is worthwhile, depends on a large number of
                   factors of which some are specific to the samples and
                   some to the technical expertise available. In a large
                   percentage of cases, creating a computer algorithm
                   may be easier than expected. In order for the reader
                   to correctly asses the difficulty level of his/her
                   specific case, an outline on how to tackle the
                   problem is presented within this chapter. The basic
                   concepts of digital imaging, explained in a possible
                   step by step approach, is offered. It is important to
                   be able to estimate the difficulty level for each
                   specific case. Based on a series of questions the
                   potential of creating a computer algorithm can be
                   offset by the costs to be expected.},

                   to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis

                   convolutional neural network models for mapping
                   lichen coverage. However, to date, it is not clear
                   how these models rank in this task. In this study,
                   these machine learning models were evaluated on their
                   ability to predict lichen percent coverage in
                   Sentinel-2 imagery in Qu{\'e}bec and Labrador,
                   Canada. The models were trained on 10-m resolution
                   lichen coverage (\%) maps created from 20 drone
                   surveys collected in July 2019 and 2022. The dense
                   neural network achieved a higher accuracy than the
                   other two, with a reported mean absolute error of
                   5.2\% and an R2 of 0.76. By comparison, the random
                   forest model returned a mean absolute error of 5.5\%
                   (R2: 0.74) and the convolutional neural network had a
                   mean absolute error of 5.3\% (R2: 0.74). A regional
                   lichen map was created using the trained dense neural
                   network and a Sentinel-2 imagery mosaic. There was
                   greater uncertainty on land covers that the model was
                   not exposed to in training, such as mines and deep
                   lakes. While the dense neural network requires more
                   computational effort to train than a random forest
                   model, the 5.9\% performance gain in the test pixel
                   comparison renders it the most suitable for lichen
                   mapping. This study represents progress toward
                   determining the appropriate methodology for

  abstract =      {The concept of optic flow, a global pattern of visual
                   motion that is both caused by and signals
                   self-motion, is canonically ascribed to James
                   Gibson's 1950 book ``The Perception of the Visual
                   World.'' There have, however, been several other
                   developments of this concept, chiefly by Gwilym
                   Grindley and Edward Calvert. Based on rarely
                   referenced scientific literature and archival
                   research, this article describes the development of
                   the concept of optic flow by the aforementioned
                   authors and several others. The article furthermore
                   presents the available evidence for interactions
                   between these authors, focusing on whether parts of
                   Gibson's proposal were derived from the work of
                   Grindley or Calvert. While Grindley's work may have
                   made Gibson aware of the geometrical facts of optic
                   flow, Gibson's work is not derivative of Grindley's.
                   It is furthermore shown that Gibson only learned of
                   Calvert's work in 1956, almost a decade after Gibson
                   first published his proposal. In conclusion, the
                   development of the concept of optic flow presents an
                   intriguing example of convergent thought in the
                   progress of science.},

                   extracting quantitative data from biological
                   microscopy imagery. The past decade has seen the
                   advent of machine learning (ML) methods to aid in
                   this process, the overwhelming majority of which fall
                   under supervised learning (SL) which requires vast
                   libraries of pre-processed, human-annotated labels to
                   train the ML algorithms. Such SL pre-processing is
                   labor intensive, can introduce bias, varies between
                   end-users, and has yet to be shown capable of robust
                   models to be effectively utilized throughout the
                   greater cell biology community. Here, to address this
                   pre-processing problem, we offer a self-supervised
                   learning (SSL) approach that utilizes cellular motion
                   between consecutive images to self-train a ML
                   classifier, enabling cell and background segmentation
                   without the need for adjustable parameters or curated
                   imagery. By leveraging motion, we achieve accurate
                   segmentation that trains itself directly on end-user
                   data, is independent of optical modality, outperforms
                   contemporary SL methods, and does so in a completely
                   automated fashion---thus eliminating end-user
                   variability and bias. To the best of our knowledge,
                   this SSL algorithm represents a first of its kind
                   effort and has appealing features that make it an
                   ideal segmentation tool candidate for the broader

                   cycle have traditionally relied on the analysis of
                   populations, and they often require specific markers
                   or the use of genetically modified systems, making it
                   difficult to determine the cell cycle stage of

                   challenging topic in computer vision and machine
                   learning research. Breast cancer is the most common
                   malignancy in women that usually involves
                   phenotypically diverse populations of breast cancer
                   cells and an heterogeneous stroma. In recent years,
                   automated microscopy technologies are allowing the
                   study of live cells over extended periods of time,
                   simplifying the task of compiling large image
                   databases. For instance, there have been several
                   studies oriented towards building machine learning
                   systems capable of automatically classifying images
                   of different cell types (i.e. motor neurons, stem
                   cells). In this work we were interested in
                   classifying breast cancer cells as live or dead,
                   based on a set of automatically retrieved
                   morphological characteristics using image processing
                   techniques. Our hypothesis is that live-dead
                   classification can be performed without any staining
                   and using only bright-field images as input. We
                   tackled this problem using the JIMT-1 breast cancer
                   cell line that grows as an adherent monolayer. First,
                   a vast image set composed by JIMT-1 human breast
                   cancer cells that had been exposed to a
                   chemotherapeutic drug treatment (doxorubicin and
                   paclitaxel) or vehicle control was compiled. Next,
                   several classifiers were trained based on well-known
                   convolutional neural networks (CNN) backbones to
                   perform supervised classification using labels
                   obtained from fluorescence microscopy images
                   associated with each bright-field image. Model
                   performances were evaluated and compared on a large
                   number of bright-field images. The best model reached
                   an AUC = 0.941 for classifying breast cancer cells
                   without treatment. Furthermore, it reached AUC =
                   0.978 when classifying breast cancer cells under drug
                   treatment. Our results highlight the potential of
                   machine learning and computational image analysis to
                   build new diagnosis tools that benefit the biomedical
                   field by reducing cost, time, and stimulating work
                   reproducibility. More importantly, we analyzed the
                   way our classifiers clusterize bright-field images in
                   the learned high-dimensional embedding and linked
                   these groups to salient visual characteristics in
                   live-dead cell biology observed by trained experts.},

                   Sciences, Inc., Lawrence, MA), was developed for

                   immunophenotyping, transfection/transduction

                   instrument allows investigators to quickly assess
                   several critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as
                   cell identity, viability, and other relevant
                   biological functions recommended by the International

                   Characterization documents focused on cellular
                   therapeutic products. In this work, we demonstrate a
                   rapid and high-throughput image cytometry detection
                   method for cellular immunophenotyping and viability
                   using the Cellaca PLX system for samples throughout
                   the cellular therapy workflow. Freshly isolated
                   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) underwent
                   red blood cell (RBC) lysis and CD3 enrichment.
                   Samples were then subsequently stained with
                   Hoechst/CD3/CD4/CD8 or Hoechst/CD3/CD8/RubyDead Dye
                   surface marker kits and measured on the Cellaca PLX
                   and three different flow cytometers for side-by-side

                   results between the two technology platforms. This
                   data shows that the Cellaca PLX Image Cytometer may

                   crucial to maintain tissue morphogenesis and
                   homeostasis, it also activates signalling pathways
                   important for the regulation of different cellular
                   processes including cell survival, gene expression,
                   collective cell migration and differentiation.
                   Importantly, gene mutations of adhesion receptors can
                   cause developmental disorders and different diseases.
                   Quantitative methods to measure cell adhesion are
                   therefore necessary to understand how cells regulate
                   cell--cell adhesion during development and how
                   aberrations in cell--cell adhesion contribute to
                   disease. Different in vitro adhesion assays have been
                   developed in the past, but not all of them are
                   suitable to study developmentally-related cell--cell
                   adhesion processes, which usually requires working
                   with low numbers of primary cells. In this review, we
                   provide an overview of different in vitro techniques
                   to study cell--cell adhesion during development,
                   including a semi-quantitative cell flipping assay,
                   and quantitative single-cell methods based on atomic
                   force microscopy (AFM)-based single-cell force
                   spectroscopy (SCFS) or dual micropipette aspiration
                   (DPA). Furthermore, we review applications of
                   F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based
                   molecular tension sensors to visualize intracellular
                   mechanical forces acting on cell adhesion sites.
                   Finally, we describe a recently introduced method to
                   quantitate cell-generated forces directly in living
                   tissues based on the deformation of oil microdroplets
                   functionalized with adhesion receptor ligands.
                   Together, these techniques provide a comprehensive
                   toolbox to characterize different cell--cell adhesion
                   phenomena during development.},

                   assays used in the author's laboratory for
                   quantitating the adhesion of cells to an immobilized
                   substrate. The attachment assay, which employs a
                   colorimetric detection of bound cells, is based on
                   Kueng et al. (Anal Biochem 182:16-19, 1989), and the
                   spreading assay, which employs phase contrast
                   microscopy to measure the flattening of adherent
                   cells, is based on the method of Yamada and Kennedy
                   (J Cell Biol 99:29-36, 1984).It is important to
                   realize that cell adhesion is a complex process that
                   involves many different molecular interactions,
                   including receptor-ligand binding, changes in the
                   fluxes through intracellular signaling pathways, and
                   modulation of cytoskeletal assembly. Consequently,
                   adhesion assays not only measure the contacts between
                   a cell and extracellular adhesion proteins, but also
                   provide information about other cellular events. For
                   this reason, care needs to be taken before choosing
                   to perform adhesion assays. The most common uses of
                   adhesion assays are (a) to test the ability of a
                   specific type of cell or cell line to adhere to a
                   specific adhesive substrate, and (b) to test the
                   sensitivity of a specific cell-substrate interaction
                   to inhibitors, but it is also apparent that adhesion
                   assays can be used to probe the contribution of other
                   cellular processes.},

                   for computer scientists. Variation in pipetting is a
                   known unknown, as it is generally accepted that
                   variations exist, but thus far, there have been
                   limited studies on the extent of these variations in
                   practice. In this mini-review, we highlight how
                   manual pipetting is a key technique in the
                   laboratory, and, although simple, inaccuracy and
                   imprecision exist. If variations are not adequately
                   addressed, errors can be compounded and consequently
                   compromise data quality. Determination of the
                   accuracy and precision of manual pipetting is
                   straightforward, and here we review two common
                   approaches that use gravimetry and spectrophotometry
                   as readouts. We also provide detailed protocols for
                   determination of accuracy and precision using manual
                   single and multi-channel pipettes. These
                   simple-to-use methods can be used by any laboratory
                   for competency training and regular checks. Having a
                   common protocol for evaluation of variation will also
                   enable cross-laboratory comparison and potentially
                   facilitate establishment of a reference value of
                   acceptable ranges for operator error. Such a value
                   could be of relevance to the scientific community for
                   benchmarking and assuring good laboratory practice.},

  abstract =      {Cell adhesion is an important part of many complex
                   biological processes. It plays crucial roles in
                   cancer, development and maintenance of stem cell
                   compartment. The measurement of adhesion under
                   experimental conditions might provide important
                   information for cell biology. There are several
                   protocols to measure adhesion, usually based on
                   washing or shaking to remove non-adherent cells.
                   Here, we describe a quantification method based on
                   gravitational force to measure adhesion in a 96-well
                   format. Non-adherent cells are separated and only
                   vital cells are quantified with a colorimetric assay.
                   This assay can be used especially when the
                   ``anti-adhesion'' effect is present only for a short
                   period of time like is the case of peptides or
                   cytokines since it provides a trap for non-adherent
                   cells in a way that they can not touch again the
                   adherent surface. As examples we provide the
                   quantification of cell-cell interaction with blocking
                   antibodies anti-CD44 in hematopoietic stem cells and
                   the effect of the stromal cell derived factor-1
                   (SDF-1) in the Jurkat cell line when they are in
                   contact with mesenchymal stromal cells. This method
                   facilitates fast and reliable measurement of cell
                   adhesion in multiwell format for screening assays.},

                   high-throughput colorimetric adhesion screening
                   method using a common laboratory centrifuge,
                   multiwell plates, and microparticles. The technique
                   uses centrifugation to apply a homogeneous mechanical
                   detachment force across individual formulations in a
                   multiwell plate. We also develop a high-throughput
                   sample deposition method to prepare films with
                   uniform thickness in each well, minimizing
                   well-to-well variability. After establishing
                   excellent agreement with the well-known probe tack
                   adhesion test, we demonstrate the consistency of our
                   method by performing the test on a multiwell plate
                   with two different formulations in an easily
                   discernible pattern. The throughput is limited only
                   by the number of wells in the plates, easily reaching
                   103 samples/run. With its simplicity, low cost, and
                   large dynamic range, this high-throughput method has
                   the potential to change the landscape of adhesive
                   material characterization., A simple, inexpensive,
                   and high-throughput colorimetric screening method for

                   selected to generate the scFv-Fc fusion protein
                   TP15-Fc with an Fc domain optimized for
                   Fc{$\gamma$}RIIIa binding. Various MM cell lines and
                   patient-derived CD138-positive malignant plasma
                   cells, but not granulocytes, B or T lymphocytes from
                   healthy donors were recognized by TP15-Fc. Human
                   intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1/CD54) was
                   identified as target antigen by using transfected
                   Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Of note, no
                   cross-reactivity of TP15-Fc with mouse ICAM-1
                   transfected cells was detected. TP15-Fc was capable
                   to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated
                   cytotoxicity (ADCC) against different human plasma
                   cell lines and patients' myeloma cells with

                   purified NK cells. Importantly, TP15-Fc showed potent
                   in vivo efficacy and completely prevented growth of
                   human INA-6.Tu1 plasma cells in a xenograft

                   dissemination, and relapse in multiple myeloma (MM),
                   with most patients dying of relapsed disease. This
                   multistage process requires tumor cells to enter the
                   circulation, extravasate, and colonize distant bone
                   marrow (BM) sites. Here, we developed a fluorescent
                   or DNA-barcode clone-tracking system on MM PrEDiCT
                   (progression through evolution and dissemination of
                   clonal tumor cells) xenograft mouse model to study
                   clonal behavior within the BM microenvironment. We
                   showed that only the few clones that successfully
                   adapt to the BM microenvironment can enter the
                   circulation and colonize distant BM sites. RNA
                   sequencing of primary and distant-site MM tumor cells
                   revealed a progression signature sequentially
                   activated along human MM progression and
                   significantly associated with overall survival when
                   evaluated against patient data sets. A total of 28
                   genes were then computationally predicted to be
                   master regulators (MRs) of MM progression. HMGA1 and
                   PA2G4 were validated in vivo using CRISPR-Cas9 in the
                   PrEDiCT model and were shown to be significantly
                   depleted in distant BM sites, indicating their role
                   in MM progression and dissemination. Loss of HMGA1
                   and PA2G4 also compromised the proliferation,
                   migration, and adhesion abilities of MM cells in
                   vitro. Overall, our model successfully recapitulates
                   key characteristics of human MM disease progression

                   mesenchymal-like state. Scattered evidence indicates
                   that additional intermediate state(s) may exist.
                   Here, to search for such states and decipher their
                   underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), we studied
                   10 melanoma cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing
                   (RNA-seq) as well as 26 additional cultures using
                   bulk RNA-seq. Although each culture exhibited a
                   unique transcriptome, we identified shared GRNs that
                   underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal
                   states and the intermediate state. This intermediate
                   state is corroborated by a distinct chromatin
                   landscape and is governed by the transcription
                   factors SOX6, NFATC2, EGR3, ELF1 and ETV4.
                   Single-cell migration assays confirmed the
                   intermediate migratory phenotype of this state. Using
                   time-series sampling of single cells after knockdown
                   of SOX10, we unravelled the sequential and recurrent
                   arrangement of GRNs during phenotype switching. Taken
                   together, these analyses indicate that an
                   intermediate state exists and is driven by a distinct
                   and stable 'mixed' GRN rather than being a symbiotic

  abstract =      {INTRODUCTION: Cytokines of the gp130-family,
                   particularly interleukin(IL)-6, play a crucial role
                   in the propagation of malignant plasma cells.
                   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The role of IL-6 and other
                   gp130-cytokines was studied in the human plasma cell
                   line INA-6 in vitro and in INA-6 xenografts. The
                   proliferative response to gp130-cytokines was
                   evaluated and activated components of gp130-signaling
                   pathways were identified by Western blotting and DNA
                   binding studies. Specifically, expression of IL-6 and
                   receptors for IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor
                   were analysed by RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: The
                   plasma cell line INA-6 was cultured for several years
                   remaining strictly dependent on exogenous IL-6. Other
                   gp130-cytokines had no significant effect on INA-6
                   cell proliferation in vitro. Due to an activating
                   mutation in the N-ras gene, mitogen-activated protein
                   kinases (MAPK) were constitutively phosphorylated. In
                   contrast, signal transducer and activator of
                   transcription(STAT)-3 activation was dependent on
                   stimulation with IL-6. Blocking of either one of
                   these pathways resulted in a significant decrease of
                   INA-6 cell proliferation. Remarkably, INA-6
                   xenografts did not require exogeneous IL-6 for
                   proliferation in vivo. Instead, an autocrine IL-6
                   loop and, in certain tumor sublines, responsiveness
                   to additional gp130-cytokines was induced during in
                   vivo growth. CONCLUSION: Activation of the gp130
                   signal transducer is mandatory for INA-6 cell growth
                   in vitro and in vivo. Both the MAPK and the Jak/STAT
                   pathway are operative in malignant plasma cells and
                   either one is essential for plasma cell growth. The
                   INA-6 cell line provides a preclinical model to study
                   growth regulation of human plasmacytoma cells and to
                   evaluate novel therapeutic strategies.},

                   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which maintain HSCs
                   in a quiescent state or sustain their proliferation,
                   differentiation, and trafficking, depending on body
                   needs. In physiological conditions, the BM niche
                   permits the daily production of all the blood and
                   immune cells and their admittance/ingress/progression
                   into the bloodstream. However, disruption of this
                   delicate microenvironment promotes the initiation and
                   progression of malignancies such as those included in
                   the spectrum of myeloid neoplasms, also favouring
                   resistance to pharmacological therapies. Alterations
                   in the MSC population and in the crosstalk with HSCs
                   owing to tumour-derived factors contribute to the
                   formation of a malignant niche. On the other hand,
                   cells of the BM microenvironment cooperate in
                   creating a unique milieu favouring metastasization of
                   distant tumours into the bone. In this framework, the
                   pro-tumorigenic role of MSCs is well-documented, and
                   few evidence suggest also an anti-tumorigenic effect.
                   Here we will review recent advances regarding the BM
                   niche composition and functionality in normal and in
                   malignant conditions, as well as the therapeutic
                   implications of the interplay between its diverse
                   cellular components and malignant cells.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

                   survive for long time periods in dedicated
                   microenvironmental survival niches, resting in terms
                   of proliferation. Several cell types, such as
                   eosinophils and reticular stromal cells, have been
                   reported to contribute to the survival niche of
                   memory PCs. However, until now it has not been
                   demonstrated whether the niche is formed by a fixed
                   cellular microenvironment. By intravital microscopy,
                   we provide for the first time evidence that the
                   direct contacts formed between PCs and reticular
                   stromal cells are stable in vivo, and thus the PCs
                   are sessile in their niches. The majority ({$\sim$}
                   80\%) of PCs directly contact reticular stromal cells
                   in a non-random fashion. The mesenchymal reticular
                   stromal cells in contact with memory PCs are not
                   proliferating. On the other hand, we show here that
                   eosinophils in the vicinity of long-lived PCs are
                   vigorously proliferating cells and represent a
                   dynamic component of the survival niche. In contrast,
                   if eosinophils are depleted by irradiation, newly
                   generated eosinophils localize in the vicinity of
                   radiation-resistant PCs and the stromal cells. These
                   results suggest that memory PC niches may provide
                   attraction for eosinophils to maintain stability with
                   fluctuating yet essential accessory cells.},

                   variation as a basis for treatment resistance, other
                   sources of variation result from cellular plasticity.
                   Using multiple myeloma as an example of an incurable
                   lymphoid malignancy, we show how cancer cells
                   modulate lineage restriction, adapt their enhancer
                   usage and employ cell-intrinsic diversity for
                   survival and treatment escape. By using single cell
                   transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiling,
                   we show that distinct transcriptional states co-exist
                   in individual cancer cells and that differential
                   transcriptional regulon usage and enhancer rewiring
                   underlie these alternate transcriptional states. We
                   demonstrate that exposure to standard treatment
                   further promotes transcriptional reprogramming and
                   differential enhancer recruitment, while
                   simultaneously reducing developmental potential.
                   Importantly, treatment generates a distinct
                   complement of actionable immunotherapy targets, such
                   as CXCR4, which can be exploited to overcome
                   treatment resistance. Our studies therefore delineate
                   how to transform the cellular plasticity that
                   underlies drug resistance into immuno-oncologic

                   examine the colon cancer cell line COLO 205, which
                   grows simultaneously in both adherent and suspended
                   states in culture and can serve as a good model for

                   of cells have different molecular characteristics
                   despite being from the same parent cell line. We
                   found that the ratio of adherent to suspended cells
                   in culture is maintained at 7:3 (equilibrium ratio).
                   The ratio was maintained even when we separate the
                   two populations and culture them separately. After
                   8~h in culture the equilibrium was achieved only from
                   either adherent or suspended population. The adherent
                   cells were found to express less E-selectin binding
                   glycans and demonstrated significantly weaker

                   methyltransferase 1 (SETDB1) is a histone H3K9
                   methyltransferase that stimulates cell proliferation
                   by methylating AKT, which contributes to drug
                   resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). Lenalidomide is
                   an immunomodulatory agent widely used in the
                   treatment of MM. However, lenalidomide resistance
                   occurs in patients with MM. Currently, the role of
                   SETDB1 in lenalidomide resistance in MM remains
                   unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the
                   functional association between SETDB1 and
                   lenalidomide resistance in MM. The analysis of GEO
                   datasets revealed that SETDB1 was upregulated in
                   lenalidomide-resistant MM cells and that its
                   expression was associated with poor prognosis of
                   patients with MM. Apoptosis analysis revealed that
                   overexpression of SETDB1 in MM cells significantly
                   decreased apoptosis, while knockdown of SETDB1
                   increased apoptosis. Furthermore, the IC50 value of
                   lenalidomide in MM cells increased following SETDB1
                   overexpression and decreased following SETDB1
                   silencing. Additionally, SETDB1 mediated
                   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activated
                   the PI3K/AKT pathway. Mechanistic analysis revealed
                   that inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling in MM cells
                   increased apoptosis, sensitized the cells to
                   lenalidomide and inhibited EMT, whereas SETDB1
                   overexpression inhibited the effects of PI3K/AKT
                   cascade inhibition. In conclusion, the findings of
                   the present study indicated that SETDB1 promoted
                   lenalidomide resistance in MM cells by promoting EMT
                   and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Thus, SETDB1 may
                   be a potential therapeutic target for MM.},

                   proliferation of plasma cells, predominantly in the
                   bone marrow. The presentation of MM in extramedullary
                   tissue, particularly the liver, is uncommon with only
                   a few reported cases in literature. We report a rare
                   and unusual presentation of kappa light chain
                   restricted MM with progression of disease to involve
                   the liver. MM was initially diagnosed on bone marrow
                   biopsy, initially treated with carfilzomib,
                   lenalidomide and dexamethasone, later changed to
                   bortezomib, daratumumab and dexamethasone. There was
                   subsequent progression with a new biopsy-proven
                   myelomatous liver lesion. The patient could not
                   receive high-dose chemotherapy due to multiple
                   co-morbidities and extent of disease and eventually
                   succumbed to her disease rapidly. This article
                   emphasizes the poor prognosis of extramedullary
                   involvement in MM and the pathogenic mechanisms by
                   which it develops. Based on a review of the
                   literature of other cases and case series of solitary
                   or diffuse myeloma involvement in the liver,
                   high-dose chemotherapy in combination with proteasome

  abstract =      {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of bone marrow (BM)
                   plasma cells, which is increasingly treatable but
                   still incurable. In 90\% of MM patients, severe
                   osteolysis results from pathological interactions
                   between MM cells and the bone microenvironment.
                   Delineating specific molecules and pathways for their
                   role in cancer supportive interactions in the BM is
                   vital for developing new therapies. Very Late Antigen
                   4 (VLA4, integrin {$\alpha$}4{$\beta$}1) is a key
                   player in cell--cell adhesion and signaling between
                   MM and BM cells. We evaluated a VLA4 selective near
                   infrared fluorescent probe, LLP2A-Cy5, for in vitro
                   and in vivo optical imaging of VLA4. Furthermore, two
                   VLA4-null murine 5TGM1 MM cell (KO) clones were
                   generated by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the Itga4
                   ({$\alpha$}4) subunit, which induced significant
                   alterations in the transcriptome. In contrast to the
                   VLA4+\,5TGM1 parental cells, C57Bl/KaLwRij
                   immunocompetent syngeneic mice inoculated with the
                   VLA4-null clones showed prolonged survival, reduced
                   medullary disease, and increased extramedullary
                   disease burden. The KO tumor foci showed
                   significantly reduced uptake of LLP2A-Cy5, confirming
                   in vivo specificity of this imaging agent. This work
                   provides new insights into the pathogenic role of
                   VLA4 in MM, and evaluates an optical tool to measure
                   its expression in preclinical models.},

  abstract =      {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal disorder of plasma
                   cells that remains, for the most part, incurable
                   despite the advent of several novel therapeutic
                   agents. Tumor cells in this disease are cradled
                   within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment by an
                   array of adhesive interactions between the BM
                   cellular residents, the surrounding extracellular
                   matrix (ECM) components such as fibronectin (FN),
                   laminin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1),
                   proteoglycans, collagens and hyaluronan, and a
                   variety of adhesion molecules on the surface of MM
                   cells including integrins, hyaluronan receptors (CD44
                   and RHAMM) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Several
                   signaling responses are activated by these
                   interactions, affecting the survival, proliferation
                   and migration of MM cells. An important consequence
                   of these direct adhesive interactions between the
                   BM/ECM and MM cells is the development of drug
                   resistance. This phenomenon is termed ``cell
                   adhesion-mediated drug resistance'' (CAM-DR) and it
                   is thought to be one of the major mechanisms by which
                   MM cells escape the cytotoxic effects of therapeutic
                   agents. This review will focus on the adhesion
                   molecules involved in the cross-talk between MM cells
                   and components of the BM microenvironment. The
                   complex signaling networks downstream of these
                   adhesive molecules mediated by direct ligand binding
                   or inside-out soluble factors signaling will also be
                   reviewed. Finally, novel therapeutic strategies
                   targeting these molecules will be discussed.
                   Identification of the mediators of MM-BM interaction
                   is essential to understand MM biology and to
                   elucidate novel therapeutic targets for this
                   disease.},

                   control MM-cell growth, survival, drug-resistance and
                   dissemination. As in MM microvascular density
                   increases in the bone marrow (BM), we investigated
                   whether BM MM endothelial cells (MMECs) control
                   disease progression via the junctional adhesion
                   molecule A (JAM-A). Membrane and cytoplasmic JAM-A
                   levels were upregulated in MMECs in 111 newly
                   diagnosed (NDMM) and 201 relapsed-refractory (RRMM)
                   patients compared to monoclonal gammopathy of
                   undetermined significance (MGUS) and healthy
                   controls. Elevated membrane expression of JAM-A on
                   MMECs predicted poor clinical outcome.
                   Mechanistically, addition of recombinant JAM-A to
                   MMECs increased angiogenesis whereas its inhibition
                   impaired angiogenesis and MM growth in 2D and 3D in
                   vitro cell culture and chorioallantoic
                   membrane-assays. To corroborate these findings, we
                   treated MM bearing mice with JAM-A blocking mAb and
                   demonstrated impaired MM progression corresponding to
                   decreased MM-related vascularity. These findings
                   support JAM-A as an important mediator of MM
                   progression through facilitating MM-associated
                   angiogenesis. Collectively, elevated JAM-A expression
                   on bone marrow endothelial cells is an independent
                   prognostic factor for patient survival in both NDMM
                   and RRMM. Blocking JAM-A restricts angiogenesis in
                   vitro, in embrio and in vivo and represents a
                   suitable druggable molecule to halt neoangiogenesis

                   accumulate in the bone marrow (BM) where their
                   interaction with the microenvironment promotes
                   disease progression and drug resistance. Previously,
                   we have shown that MM cells cocultured with
                   BM-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) comodulated cells'
                   phenotype in a MAPKs/translation initiation
                   (TI)-dependent manner. Dissection of the coculture
                   model showed that BM-MSCs secretomes and
                   microvesicles (MVs) participate in this crosstalk.
                   Here, we addressed the role of the BM-MSCs
                   extracellular matrix (ECM). MM cell lines cultured on
                   decellularized ECM of normal donors' (ND) or MM
                   patients' BM-MSCs were assayed for phenotype
                   (viability, cell count, death, proliferation,
                   migration, and invasion), microRNAs (MIR125a-3p,
                   MIR199a-3p) and targets, MAPKs, TI
                   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), CXCR4,
                   and autophagy. Drug (doxorubicin, velcade) response
                   of MM cells cultured on ND/MM-MSCs' ECM with/without
                   adhered MVs was also evaluated. ECM evoked opposite
                   responses according to its origin: MM cells cultured
                   on ND-MSCs' ECM demonstrated a rapid and continued
                   decrease in MAPK/TI activation
                   ({\textdownarrow}10\%-25\%, P {$<$} 0.05) (15-24
                   hours) followed by diminished viability, cell count,
                   proliferation, migration, and invasion (16-72 hours)
                   ({\textdownarrow}10\%-50\%, P {$<$} 0.05). In
                   contrast, MM cells cultured on MM-MSCs' ECM displayed
                   activated MAPK/TI, proliferation, EMT, and CXCR4
                   ({$\uparrow$}15\%-250\%, P {$<$} 0.05). Corresponding
                   changes in microRNAs relevant to the MM cells'
                   altered phenotype were also determined. The hierarchy
                   and interdependence of MAPKs/TI/autophagy/phenotype
                   cascade were demonstrated. Finally, we showed that
                   the ECM cooperates with MVs to modulate MM cells drug
                   response. These data demonstrate the contribution of
                   BM-MSCs' ECM to MM niche design and underscore the
                   clinical potential of identifying targetable
                   signals.},

                   cancer involving proliferation of abnormal plasma
                   cells that infiltrate the bone marrow (BM) and
                   secrete monoclonal antibodies. The disease is
                   clinically characterized by bone lesions, anemia,
                   hypercalcemia, and renal failure. MM is presently
                   treated with conventional therapies like melphalan,
                   doxorubicin, and prednisone; or novel therapies like
                   thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib; or with
                   procedures like autologous stem cell transplantation.
                   Unfortunately, these therapies fail to eliminate the
                   minimal residual disease that remains persistent
                   within the confines of the BM of MM patients.
                   Mounting evidence indicates that components of the
                   BM---including extracellular matrix, cytokines,
                   chemokines, and growth factors---provide a sanctuary
                   for subpopulations of MM. This co-dependent
                   development of the disease in the context of the BM
                   not only ensures the survival and growth of the
                   plasma cells but contributes to de novo drug
                   resistance. In addition, by fostering homing,
                   angiogenesis, and osteolysis, this crosstalk plays a
                   critical role in the progression of the disease. Not
                   surprisingly then, over the past decade, several
                   strategies have been developed to disrupt this
                   communication between the plasma cells and the BM
                   components including antibodies, peptides, and
                   inhibitors of signaling pathways. Ultimately, the
                   goal is to use these therapies in combination with
                   the existing antimyeloma agents in order to further
                   reduce or abolish minimal residual disease and
                   improve patient outcomes.},

                   mg]) or matching placebo in 3:1 ratio in healthy
                   individuals. Safety monitoring included vital signs,
                   laboratory examinations (including hematology,
                   coagulation, platelet function, chemistry, myocardial
                   toxicity) and electrocardiography (to measure effect
                   on PR, QRS, and QTc). Results Treatment with SP16 was
                   not associated with treatment related serious adverse
                   events. SP16 was associated with mild-moderate pain
                   at the time of injection that was significantly
                   higher than placebo on a 0--10 pain scale (6.0+/-1.4
                   [0.2 mg/kg] versus 1.5+/-2.1 [placebo], P = 0.0088).
                   No differences in vital signs, laboratory
                   examinations and electrocardiography were found in
                   those treated with SP16 versus placebo. Conclusion A
                   one-time treatment with SP16 for doses up to 0.2
                   mg/kg or 12 mg was safe in healthy volunteers.},

                   increasing attention as an important factor
                   influencing the progression and prognosis of tumor
                   diseases. In multiple myeloma (MM), a hematological
                   cancer of plasma cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
                   represent an integral part of the bone marrow niche
                   and tumor microenvironment. It has been described
                   that MM cells alter MSCs in a way that MM-associated
                   MSCs promote the proliferation and survival of MM
                   cells. Yet, our understanding of the molecular
                   mechanisms governing the interaction between MM cells
                   and MSCs and whether this can be targeted for
                   therapeutic interventions is limited. To identify
                   potential molecular targets, we examined MSCs by RNA
                   sequencing and Western blot analysis. We report that
                   MSCs from MM patients with active disease
                   (MM-Act-MSCs) show a distinct gene expression profile
                   as compared with MSCs from patients with other (non-)
                   malignant diseases (CTR-MSCs). Of note, we detected a
                   significant enrichment of the PI3K--AKT--mTOR
                   hallmark gene set in MM-Act-MSCs and further
                   confirmed the increased levels of related proteins in
                   these MSCs. Pictilisib, a pan-PI3K inhibitor,
                   selectively reduced the proliferation of MM-Act-MSCs
                   as compared with CTR-MSCs. Furthermore, pictilisib
                   treatment impaired the MM-promoting function of
                   MM-Act-MSCs. Our data thus provide a deeper insight
                   into the molecular signature and function of MSCs
                   associated with MM and show that targeting
                   PI3K--AKT--mTOR signaling in MSCs may represent an
                   additional therapeutic pathway in the treatment of MM
                   patients.},

  abstract =      {Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have limited
                   efficacy against solid tumors due to the hostile
                   microenvironment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are
                   essential to metastasis, which is the cause of most
                   of cancer-related death. Here, we generated GrB-CAR T
                   cells targeting membrane-bound HSP70 (mHSP70), a
                   highly tumor-specific antigen detected in numerous
                   cancers. GrB-CAR T cells exhibited potent
                   cytotoxicity against a broad spectrum of cancer cell
                   lines and stem-like cancer cells in vitro and
                   effectively inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo.
                   Importantly, GrB-CAR T cells markedly decreased the
                   number of CTCs and, therefore, hindered cancer
                   metastasis in spontaneous metastasis models with
                   uncontrollable primary tumor growth, a scenario
                   commonly encountered in clinical trials of CAR T
                   therapies for solid tumors. Furthermore, despite the
                   100\% homology between human and macaque HSP70
                   protein, the autotransplantation of macaque T cells
                   expressing human GrB-CAR did not cause any obvious
                   toxic effects. These results not only demonstrate
                   GrB-CAR T cells as a safe and effective tactic with
                   broad-spectrum anticancer activity, but also offer
                   strong experimental evidence and proof-of-concept
                   validation for CAR T cell-mediated metastasis
                   inhibition by targeting CTCs.},

                   notorious for its high relapse rate and development
                   of drug resistance, in which cell adhesion-mediated
                   drug resistance plays a critical role. This study
                   integrated four RNA sequencing datasets (CoMMpass,
                   GSE136337, GSE9782, and GSE2658) and focused on
                   analyzing 1706 adhesion-related genes. Rigorous
                   univariate Cox regression analysis identified 18 key
                   prognosis-related genes, including KIF14, TROAP,
                   FLNA, MSN, LGALS1, PECAM1, and ALCAM, which
                   demonstrated the strongest associations with poor
                   overall survival (OS) in MM patients. To
                   comprehensively evaluate the impact of cell adhesion
                   on MM prognosis, an adhesion-related risk score
                   (ARRS) model was constructed using Lasso Cox
                   regression analysis. The ARRS model emerged as an
                   independent prognostic factor for predicting OS.
                   Furthermore, our findings revealed that a heightened
                   cell adhesion effect correlated with tumor resistance
                   to DNA-damaging drugs, protein kinase inhibitors, and
                   drugs targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
                   Nevertheless, we identified promising drug
                   candidates, such as tirofiban, pirenzepine,
                   erlotinib, and bosutinib, which exhibit potential in
                   reversing this resistance. \emph{In vitro},
                   experiments employing NCIH929, RPMI8226, and AMO1
                   cell lines confirmed that MM cell lines with high
                   ARRS exhibited poor sensitivity to the aforementioned
                   candidate drugs. By employing siRNA-mediated
                   knockdown of the key ARRS model gene KIF14, we
                   observed suppressed proliferation of NCIH929 cells,
                   along with decreased adhesion to BMSCs and
                   fibronectin. This study presents compelling evidence
                   establishing cell adhesion as a significant
                   prognostic factor in MM. Additionally, potential
                   molecular mechanisms underlying adhesion-related
                   resistance are proposed, along with viable strategies
                   to overcome such resistance. These findings provide a
                   solid scientific foundation for facilitating
                   clinically stratified treatment of MM.},

                   scientists to characterize cell states that emerge
                   during cancer progression through temporal sampling,
                   connecting these samples over time and inferring
                   gene-gene relationships that promote cancer
                   plasticity remains a challenge. To address these
                   challenges, we developed TrajectoryNet, a neural
                   ordinary differential equation network that learns
                   continuous dynamics via interpolation of population
                   flows between sampled timepoints. By running
                   causality analysis on the output of TrajectoryNet, we
                   compute rich and complex gene-gene networks that
                   drive pathogenic trajectories forward. Applying this
                   pipeline to scRNAseq data generated from in vitro
                   models of breast cancer, we identify and validate a
                   refined CD44 hi EPCAM + CAV1 + marker profile that
                   improves the identification and isolation of cancer
                   stem cells (CSCs) from bulk cell populations.
                   Studying the cell plasticity trajectories emerging
                   from this population, we identify comprehensive
                   temporal regulatory networks that drive cell fate
                   decisions between an epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT)
                   trajectory, and a mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET)
                   trajectory. Through these studies, we identify and
                   validate estrogen related receptor alpha as a
                   critical mediator of CSC plasticity. We further apply
                   TrajectoryNet to an in vivo xenograft model and
                   demonstrate it's ability to elucidate trajectories
                   governing primary tumor metastasis to the lung,
                   identifying a dominant EMT trajectory that includes
                   elements of our newly-defined temporal EMT regulatory
                   network. Demonstrated here in cancer, the
                   TrajectoryNet pipeline is a transformative approach

                   drug resistance (CAM-DR) of B-cell ALL by binding to
                   vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on bone
                   marrow stroma. In addition, it was previously
                   observed that the blockade of {$\alpha$}4 with
                   natalizumab or inhibition using the small molecule
                   antagonist TBC3486 sensitized relapsed ALL cells to
                   chemotherapy. However, {$\alpha$}4-targeted therapy
                   is not clinically available for the treatment of
                   leukemia to date. In the present study, the use of a
                   novel non-peptidic small molecule integrin
                   {$\alpha$}4 antagonist, AVA4746, as a potential new
                   approach to combat drug-resistant B-ALL was explored.
                   An in vitro co-culture = model of primary B-ALL cells
                   and an in vivo xenograft model of patient-derived
                   B-ALL cells were utilized for evaluation of AVA4746.
                   VLA-4 conformation activation, cell
                   adhesion/de-adhesion, endothelial tube formation, in
                   vivo leukemia cell mobilization and survival assays
                   were performed. AVA4746 exhibited high affinity for
                   binding to B-ALL cells, where it also efficiently
                   blocked ligand-binding to VCAM-1. In addition,
                   AVA4746 caused the functional de-adhesion of primary
                   B-ALL cells from VCAM-1. Inhibition of {$\alpha$}4
                   using AVA4746 also prevented angiogenesis in vitro
                   and when applied in combination with chemotherapy
                   consisting of Vincristine, Dexamethasone and
                   L-asparaginase, it prolonged the survival of
                   {\textasciitilde}33\% of the mice in an in vivo
                   xenograft model of B-ALL. These data implicate the
                   potential of targeting the {$\alpha$}4-VCAM-1
                   interaction using AVA4746 for the treatment of
                   drug-resistant B-lineage ALL.},

                   critical role in inflammation, immunity, cell
                   proliferation, apoptosis, and muscle metabolism.
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B is activated by extracellular signals
                   and intracellular changes in Ca2+, Pi, H+,
                   metabolites and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
                   (RONS). However, it remains unknown how
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B signalling is activated during
                   exercise and how metabolite accumulation and PO2
                   influence this process. Eleven active men performed
                   incremental exercise to exhaustion (IE) in normoxia
                   and hypoxia (PIO2:73~mmHg). Immediately after IE, the
                   circulation of one leg was instantaneously occluded
                   (300~mmHg). Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis
                   were taken before (Pre), and 10s (Post, occluded leg)
                   and 60s after exercise from the occluded (Oc1m) and
                   free circulation (FC1m) legs simultaneously together
                   with femoral vein blood samples. NF-{$\kappa$}B
                   signalling was activated by exercise to exhaustion,
                   with similar responses in normoxia and acute hypoxia,
                   as reflected by the increase of p105, p50,
                   IKK{$\alpha$}, I{$\kappa$}B{$\beta$} and glutathione
                   reductase (GR) protein levels, and the activation of
                   the main kinases implicated, particularly
                   IKK{$\alpha$} and CaMKII {$\delta$}D, while
                   IKK{$\beta$} remained unchanged. Postexercise
                   ischaemia maintained and stimulated further
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B signalling by impeding muscle
                   reoxygenation. These changes were quickly reverted at
                   the end of exercise when the muscles recovered with
                   open circulation. Finally, we have shown that
                   Thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) protein expression was reduced
                   immediately after IE and after 1~min of occlusion
                   while the protein expression levels of glutathione
                   peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and thioredoxin reductase 1
                   (TrxR1) remained unchanged. These novel data
                   demonstrate that exercising to exhaustion activates
                   NF-{$\kappa$}B signalling in human skeletal muscle
                   and regulates the expression levels of antioxidant
                   enzymes in human skeletal muscle. The fast regulation
                   of NF-{$\kappa$}B at exercise cessation has
                   implications for the interpretation of published
                   studies and the design of new experiments., Schematic

                   severe acute hypoxia in human skeletal muscle,

                   to exhaustion in normoxia and severe hypoxia

                   important therapeutic implications, yet its
                   demonstration has been hampered by a lack of
                   consistency in terms and definitions. Here, we
                   summarize the current documentation and propose
                   single-cell in vitro studies for future translational
                   studies. By the classical approach, a
                   CD19-/CD45low/-/CD38high/CD138+ malignant plasma
                   cell, but not the CD19+/CD38low/- memory B cell
                   compartment, is enriched for tumorigenic cells that
                   initiate myeloma in xenografted immunodeficient mice,
                   supporting that myeloma stem cells are present in the
                   malignant PC compartment. Using a new approach,
                   analysis of c-DNA libraries from CD19+/CD27+/CD38-
                   single cells has identified clonotypic memory B cell,
                   suggested to be the cell of origin. This is
                   consistent with multiple myeloma being a multistep
                   hierarchical process before or during clinical
                   presentation. We anticipate that further
                   characterization will require single cell geno- and
                   phenotyping combined with clonogenic assays. To
                   implement such technologies, we propose a revision of
                   the concept of a myeloma stem cell by including
                   operational in vitro assays to describe the cellular
                   components of origin, initiation, maintenance, and
                   evolution of multiple myeloma. These terms are in
                   accordance with recent (2012) consensus statements on
                   the definitions, assays, and nomenclature of cancer
                   stem cells, which is technically precise without
                   completely abolishing established terminology. We
                   expect that this operational model will be useful for
                   future reporting of parameters used to identify and
                   characterize the multiple myeloma stem cells. We
                   strongly recommend that these parameters include
                   validated standard technologies, reproducible assays,
                   and, most importantly, supervised prospective
                   sampling of selected biomaterial which reflects
                   clinical stages, disease spectrum, and therapeutic
                   outcome. This framework is key to the
                   characterization of the cellular architecture of
                   multiple myeloma and its use in precision medicine.},

  abstract =      {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm that
                   accounts for 2\% of all haematological malignancies
                   and predominantly affects older individuals (with a
                   median age at diagnosis of 65-70 years). MM is
                   consistently preceded by the clinically recognized
                   precancerous stages monoclonal gammopathy of
                   undetermined significance and smouldering MM. Thus
                   far, MM has been considered as a single disease
                   entity, but the clinical presentation, response to
                   treatment, and survival outcomes of patients with MM
                   are quite heterogeneous and highly dependent on a set
                   of chromosomal abnormalities that can be identified
                   in nearly all of them. These alterations include
                   primary cytogenetic abnormalities, such as
                   translocations involving chromosome 14q and trisomies
                   of odd-numbered chromosomes, as well as secondary
                   abnormalities, such as deletion of chromosome 17p and
                   amplification of chromosome 1q. The aetiology of
                   myeloma is poorly understood, although different
                   nonoverlapping disease entities can be defined on the
                   basis of their specific primary cytogenetic
                   abnormalities, which have a major role in determining
                   clinical behaviour. This classification might enable
                   the development of better treatment strategies
                   focused on the underlying biology of each specific
                   subtype. Herein, we describe treatment approaches
                   that incorporate the current standard of care for
                   patients with MM along with recommended alterations
                   or improvements that might provide additional
                   clinical benefit for certain subgroups of patients.},

                   normal gene function through insertions, inversions,
                   translocations, and copy number changes, including
                   deletions and duplications. Detecting structural
                   variants is crucial for revealing their roles in
                   tumor development, clinical outcomes, and
                   personalized therapy. Presently, most studies rely on
                   short-read data from next-generation sequencing that
                   aligns back to a reference genome to determine if
                   and, if so, where a structural variant occurs.
                   However, structural variant discovery by short-read
                   sequencing is challenging, primarily because of the
                   difficulty in mapping regions of repetitive
                   sequences. Optical genome mapping (OGM) is a recent
                   technology used for imaging and assembling long DNA
                   strands to detect structural variations. To capture
                   the structural variant landscape more thoroughly in
                   the human genome, we developed an integrated pipeline
                   that combines Bionano OGM and Illumina whole-genome
                   sequencing and applied it to samples from 29
                   pediatric B-ALL patients. The addition of OGM allowed
                   us to identify 511 deletions, 506 insertions, 93
                   duplications/gains, and 145 translocations that were
                   otherwise missed in the short-read data. Moreover, we
                   identified several novel gene fusions, the expression
                   of which was confirmed by RNA sequencing. Our results
                   highlight the benefit of integrating OGM and
                   short-read detection methods to obtain a
                   comprehensive analysis of genetic variation that can
                   aid in clinical diagnosis, provide new therapeutic
                   targets, and improve personalized medicine in cancers

                   crucially involved in the development of osteolytic
                   bone lesions in multiple myeloma (MM). The current
                   study was designed to determine the direct effects of
                   MIP-1 alpha on MM cells. Thus, we were able to
                   demonstrate that MIP-1 alpha acts as a potent growth,
                   survival, and chemotactic factor in MM cells. MIP-1
                   alpha-induced signaling involved activation of the
                   AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) and the mitogen-activated
                   protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In addition,
                   inhibition of AKT activation by phosphatidylinositol
                   3- kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors did not influence MAPK

                   development of osteolytic bone destruction, MIP-1

                   mediating growth, survival, and migration in MM cells

                   bone resorption in patients with myeloma is poorly
                   understood. In the present study, we investigated a
                   role of C-C chemokines, macrophage inflammatory
                   protein (MIP)--1{$\alpha$} and MIP-1{$\beta$}, in MM
                   cell-induced osteolysis. These chemokines were
                   produced and secreted by a majority of MM cell lines
                   as well as primary MM cells from patients. Secretion
                   of MIP-1{$\alpha$} and MIP-1{$\beta$} correlated well
                   with the ability of myeloma cells to enhance
                   osteoclastic bone resorption both in vitro and in
                   vivo as well as in MM patients. In osteoclastogenic
                   cultures of rabbit bone cells, cocultures with
                   myeloma cells as well as addition of myeloma
                   cell-conditioned media enhanced both formation of
                   osteoclastlike cells and resorption pits to an extent
                   comparable to the effect of recombinant
                   MIP-1{$\alpha$} and MIP-1{$\beta$}. Importantly,
                   these effects were mostly reversed by neutralizing
                   antibodies against MIP-1{$\alpha$} and
                   MIP-1{$\beta$}, or their cognate receptor, CCR5,
                   suggesting critical roles of these chemokines. We
                   also demonstrated that stromal cells express CCR5 and
                   that recombinant MIP-1{$\alpha$} and MIP-1{$\beta$}
                   induce expression of receptor activator of nuclear
                   factor-{$\kappa$}B (RANK) ligand by stromal cells,
                   thereby stimulating osteoclast differentiation of
                   preosteoclastic cells. These results suggest that
                   MIP-1{$\alpha$} and MIP-1{$\beta$} may be major

                   conditions via (re)modeling (modeling and remodeling)
                   processes. While physical activity is known to
                   beneficially enhance bone mass in healthy
                   individuals, little is known in how physical stimuli
                   affect osteolytic bone destruction in patients
                   suffering from multiple myeloma bone disease.
                   Multiple myeloma (MM) is caused by malignant plasma
                   cells in the bone marrow, shifting the balance in
                   bone remodeling towards massive resorption. We
                   hypothesized that in vivo tibial mechanical loading
                   has anabolic effects in mice with locally injected
                   MOPC315.BM.Luc cells. Conventional microCT analysis
                   revealed enhanced cortical bone mass and
                   microstructure in loaded compared to nonloaded mice.
                   State-of-the-art time-lapse microCT based image
                   analysis demonstrated bone (re)modeling processes at
                   the endosteal and periosteal surfaces as the
                   underlying causes of increased bone mass. Loading
                   prevented the progression and development of
                   osteolytic destruction. Physical stimuli also
                   diminished local MM cell growth and dissemination
                   evidenced by quantification of MM cell-specific
                   immunoglobulin A levels in the serum of mice and by
                   bioluminescence analysis. These data indicate that
                   mechanical loading not only rescues the bone
                   phenotype, but also exerts cell-extrinsic
                   anti-myeloma effects in the MOPC315.BM.Luc model. In
                   conclusion, the use of physical stimuli should be
                   further investigated as an anabolic treatment for
                   osteolytic bone destruction in patients with MM.},

                   have demonstrated that proliferation and cellular

                   therefore important to determine if they favor
                   outgrowth of different subpopulations and thereby
                   impact on the heterogeneous composition of MSCs. We
                   have isolated and expanded human bone marrow-derived
                   MSCs in parallel with HPL or FCS and demonstrated
                   that HPL significantly increases proliferation and
                   leads to dramatic differences in cellular morphology.
                   Remarkably, global DNA-methylation profiles did not
                   reveal any significant differences. Even at the

                   changes in pairwise comparison. Furthermore, the

                   and focal adhesions were reversible by interchanging
                   to opposite culture conditions. These results
                   indicate that cultivation of MSCs with HPL or FCS has

  abstract =      {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal B-lymphocyte
                   malignancy, which is characterized by the
                   accumulation of terminally differentiated
                   antibody-producing cells in the bone marrow. Because
                   current treatments offer only a median survival of 3
                   years, investigators continue to search for novel
                   therapeutic strategies to combat the disease.
                   Rational drug design is enhanced by understanding MM
                   cell proliferation and key signaling pathways
                   employed. In addition, a model system for preclinical
                   evaluation of novel therapeutics is critical. Our
                   laboratory has developed MM cell lines to study drug
                   action and resistance, cell proliferation, and
                   apoptosis. These cell lines are widely used in MM
                   research. From a single MM patient, three separate
                   cell lines were established that parallel the
                   progression of the disease. These three cell lines,
                   designated MM1.S, MM1.R(E), and MM1.R(L), can be
                   distinguished on the basis of their sensitivity to
                   steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids (GCs).
                   Utilization of these cell lines to study the etiology
                   of MM, effects of chemotherapeutic agents, and
                   development of clinical resistance, will provide us
                   with vital information for the evolution of new and
                   more efficacious therapeutics. The aim of this review
                   is to summarize the morphological, biochemical, and
                   growth characteristics of these cells, and to review
                   the results from investigations of the MM.1 signaling
                   pathways. This information will enhance the study,
                   treatment, and eventual eradication of MM.},

                   to the culture plates and may be vulnerable to cell
                   detachment during passage. Therefore, it is important
                   to harvest cells with a proper detaching method to
                   maintain the viability of cells after detachment.
                   Trypsinization is frequently used for cellular
                   dissociation and detachment. However, most surface
                   proteins and the extracellular matrix are degraded by
                   enzymatic digestion. A mild cell detachment buffer,
                   accutase, is recommended for the replacement of
                   trypsin to dissociate adherent cells and thereby
                   avoid cellular damage. In this study, we demonstrated
                   that use of accutase for cellular detachment may
                   compromise some surface proteins. Compared with
                   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-based
                   nonenzymatic cell dissociation buffers, accutase was
                   associated with significant decreases in the surface
                   Fas ligands and Fas receptors. Moreover, we found
                   that accutase may be able to cleave surface Fas
                   ligands into pieces. Our results also illustrated
                   that surface proteins required 20~h to recover after
                   accutase treatment. We demonstrated that using
                   accutase to dissociate adherent cells compromised the
                   expression of Fas ligands and Fas receptors on the
                   cell surface. These findings indicate that it is
                   important to choose suitable cell detachment buffers

                   long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different
                   sequencing platforms. It is flexible in style,
                   compact in size, efficient in random access and is
                   the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes
                   Project are released. SAMtools implements various
                   utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM
                   format, such as indexing, variant caller and
                   alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools
                   for processing read alignments.Availability:

  abstract =      {It is expected that emerging digital gene expression
                   (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray
                   technologies in the near future for many functional
                   genomics applications. One of the fundamental data
                   analysis tasks, especially for gene expression
                   studies, involves determining whether there is
                   evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are
                   significantly different across experimental
                   conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package
                   for examining differential expression of replicated
                   count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to
                   account for both biological and technical
                   variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to
                   moderate the degree of overdispersion across
                   transcripts, improving the reliability of inference.
                   The methodology can be used even with the most
                   minimal levels of replication, provided at least one
                   phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.
                   The software may have other applications beyond
                   sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count
                   data.The package is freely available under the LGPL

                   The class contains as special cases the log rank test
                   (Mantel, 1966; Cox, 1972) and a test essentially
                   equivalent to Peto \& Peto's (1972) generalization of
                   the Wilcoxon test. martingale theory is used to
                   establish asymptotic normality of test statistics
                   under the null hypotheses considered, and to derive
                   expressions for asymptotic relative efficiencies
                   under contiguous sequences of alternative hypotheses.
                   A class of distributions is presented which
                   corresponds to the class of rank statistics in the
                   sense that for each distribution there is a statistic
                   with some optimal properties for detecting location
                   alternatives from that distribution. Some Monte Carlo
                   results are displayed which present small sample
